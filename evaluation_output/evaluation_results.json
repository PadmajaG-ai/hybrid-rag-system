In addition, Mamluk beys came to hold important military positions within Egypt, giving them a power source with which to challenge Ottoman-appointed governors. The governors appointed thence came to be treated by the Egyptians with continually decreasing respect. In July 1623, an order came from the Porte dismissing Kara Mustafa Pasha , and appointing Çeşteci Ali Pasha governor in his place. The officers met the deputy of the newly appointed governor and demanded from him the customary gratuity; when the deputy refused, they sent letters to the Porte declaring that they wished to have Kara Mustafa Pasha, and not Çeşteci Ali Pasha, as governor. Meanwhile, Çeşteci Ali Pasha had arrived at Alexandria and was met by a deputation from Cairo telling him that he was not wanted. He returned a mild answer; when a rejoinder came in the same style as the first message, he had the leader of the deputation arrested and imprisoned. The garrison of Alexandria then attacked the castle and rescued the prisoner, whereupon Çeşteci Ali Pasha was compelled to reembark on his ship and escape. Shortly thereafter, a rescript arrived from Constantinople confirming Kara Mustafa Pasha in the governorship. Mustafa was succeeded by Bayram Pasha in 1626. Officers in the Ottoman Egyptian army were appointed locally from the various militias, and had strong ties to the Egyptian aristocracy.",

History of the Hotak Dynasty [ edit ] Rise to power and Reign of Mirwais Hotak [ edit ] Decline of the Safavids [ edit ] The Shi'a Safavids ruled Loy Kandahar as their easternmost territory from the 16th century until the early 18th century. At the same time, the native Afghan tribes living in the area were Sunni Muslims . Immediately to the east was the powerful Sunni Mughal Empire , who occasionally fought wars with the powerful Safavids over the territory of southern Afghanistan. The Khanate of Bukhara controlled the area to the north at the same time. By the late 17th century, the Safavids started to decline. With the death of Shah Abbas in 1629, succeeding Safavid rulers were less effective and caused the empire to decline. On 29 July 1694, Shah Suleiman died and Sultan Husayn took the throne. Under his reign the problems worsened. Husayn barely left the palace during his reign, not an uncommon aspect of many later Safavid Shahs. Later Safavid rulers were immobile and their courts were riddled with factionalism unlike their more mobile ancestors who spent more time on campaigns and had smaller courts. The government was weak and the army was ineffective. This power vacuum allowed tribal groups like the Turkmen , Baluch , Arabs , Kurds , Dagestanis , and Afghans to constantly raid frontier provinces. Governorship of Gurgin Khan [ edit ] In 1704, the Safavid Shah Husayn appointed his Georgian subject and king of Kartli George XI ( Gurgīn Khān ), a convert to Islam , as the governor of Kandahar .",

It was established in 1709 by Mirwais Hotak , who led a successful rebellion against the declining Persian Safavid empire in the region of Loy Kandahar (\"Greater Kandahar\") in what is now southern Afghanistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of natural causes and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded him. He did not reign long as he was killed by his nephew Mahmud , who overthrew the Safavid Shah and established his own rule over Iran. Mahmud in turn was succeeded by his cousin Ashraf following a palace coup in 1725. Ashraf also did not retain his throne for long, as the Iranian conqueror Nader-Qoli Beg (later Shah ), under the resurgent Safavid banner, defeated him at the Battle of Damghan in 1729. Ashraf Hotak was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan, limiting Hotak rule to just a small corner of their once large empire. Hotak rule came to an end in 1738, when Nader Shah defeated Ashraf's successor Hussain Hotak after the lengthy siege of Kandahar . Subsequently, Nader Shah began re-establishing Iranian suzerainty over regions lost to Iran's archrivals, the Ottoman and Russian Empires , decades earlier.",

North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuruí Dam , which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory. As of July 2022, according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%. While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%; the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior. In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country. In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current demand. In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW), and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany. Nuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity. The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A) , a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás . Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra . It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis , Rio de Janeiro .",

          "text": "At the same time, a contract to build the three-phase AC distribution system the project needed was awarded to General Electric. The early to mid-1890s saw General Electric, backed by financier J. P. Morgan , engaged in costly takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. The competition was so costly that in 1896 a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies. The agreement stayed in effect until 1911. Following the success of the first Niagara Falls plant, the Rankine Generating Station , also known as The Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station, the Canadians contracted with Westinghouse for eleven 25 Hertz generators of the same Tesla-inspired design, rated for a total generating capacity of 100 MW. That facility opened in 1905 in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Other Westinghouse projects: steam engines, maritime propulsion, and shock absorbers [ edit ] Despite continuing success in his other businesses, Westinghouse's main interest shifted to electric power generation. At the outset, the available generating sources were hydro turbines where falling water was available, and reciprocating steam engines where it was not. Westinghouse felt that existing reciprocating steam engines were clumsy and inefficient, and he wanted to develop rotating engines that would be more elegant. His first patent had been for a rotary steam engine, but it proved impractical at the time. In 1884, the British engineer Charles Algernon Parsons at Clarke, Chapman and Co began experimenting with steam turbines and generators, producing a 10-horsepower (7.5 kW) turbo-generator. In 1895, Westinghouse bought rights to the Parsons turbine, and his engineers improved its technology and increased its scale. In 1898, Westinghouse demonstrated a 300-kilowatt generating unit, replacing reciprocating engines in his air-brake factory.",

In the late 1890s, Heinemann and the American publisher Frank Doubleday financially supported Joseph Conrad during his initial attempt at writing what eventually became The Rescue , and Heinemann was the British publisher for Conrad's The Nigger of the 'Narcissus' in 1897. One of the company's businesses at that time was to sell English books to a Japan that was beginning to be interested in items of Western culture. Heinemann sold to the Japanese bookstore Maruzen translations of the works of Dostoyevsky and 5000 copies of Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution by Peter Kropotkin. In 1912, the company began publishing the Loeb Classical Library series, publications of ancient works with the Greek or Latin text on the left-hand page, and a literal translation on the right hand page. The series has been called \"the most significant\" of the parallel-text translations. Since 1934, it has been co-published with Harvard University . On Heinemann's death in 1920 a majority stake was purchased by U.S. publisher Doubleday , with Theodore Byard , who had previously been a professional singer, joining to lead the offices. A subsidiary company was established in The Hague in 1953; originally intended to distribute works in English to continental Europe, it eventually began to directly print Heinemann's books as well. The company was later acquired by conglomerate Thomas Tilling in 1961. When the impending takeover became known, Graham Greene (who had been with Heinemann since his first work in 1929) led a number of Heinemann authors who protested by taking their works to other publishers, including The Bodley Head , of which Greene was a director. Heinemann Publishing was established in the United States in 1978 as a U.S.",

Their first published book, 1890's The Bondman , was a huge success in the United Kingdom and launched the company. He was joined in 1893 by Sydney Pawling . Heinemann died in 1920 and Pawling sold the company to Doubleday , having worked with them in the past to publish their works in the United States. Pawling died in 1922 and new management took over. Doubleday sold his interest in 1933. Through the 1920s, the company was well known for publishing works by famous authors that had previously been published as serials . Among these were works by H. G. Wells , Rudyard Kipling , W. Somerset Maugham , George Moore , Max Beerbohm and Henry James , among others. This attracted new authors to publish their first editions with the company, including Graham Greene , Edward Upward , J. B. Priestley and Vita Sackville-West . Throughout, the company was also known for its classics and international catalogue, and in the post-WWII era, the company focused on educational materials. Through the 1950s, the company was slowly taken over by Tilling Group 's investment arm. In 1953 they opened offices in The Hague for sales in continental Europe, and in 1978 they opened a separate company in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to sell their educational works in the US market. When Tilling was purchased by BTR plc in 1983, BTR sold off all their non-industrial assets; Heinemann was sold to Octopus Publishing Group . Octopus merged with Reed International (later Reed Elsevier) in 1987, who then sold their entire trade-oriented publishing assets to Random House in 1997.",

Political Treatise: Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be [ edit ] Albania cannot exist without the Albanians, the Albanians cannot exist without the Albanian language, and the latter cannot exist without its own alphabet and without schools. — Sami Frashëri, excerpt from Albania , The aforementioned booklet Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be was first published in Albanian without the author's name in 1899, then in French , and in 1904, right after Şemseddin Sami's death, it was published in Sofia under his name and in Turkish with the condition that it was \"literally translated from Albanian\". Turkish historians generally do not accept that this work belongs to Şemseddin Sami and consider the event as an effort to gain prestige to Albanian nationalism by using Şemseddin Sami's reputation and prestige. Considering Şemseddin Sami's intense interest in the issues of Turkishness and Ottomanism, especially in his last years, it can be thought that there is some truth in this view. On the other hand, in Albanian works, there is not the slightest doubt that the Albanian manifesto belongs to Şemseddin Sâmi. The booklet was smuggled out of the Ottoman Empire and published in Bucharest with the identity of the author not appearing in the publication. Publishers from Austro-Hungary printed some of Frashëri's most important works containing nationalist themes with Austro-Hungarian Albanologists Theodor Anton Ippen and Baron Nopcsa financing the translation and distribution of his publications.",

It was established in 1709 by Mirwais Hotak , who led a successful rebellion against the declining Persian Safavid empire in the region of Loy Kandahar (\"Greater Kandahar\") in what is now southern Afghanistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of natural causes and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded him. He did not reign long as he was killed by his nephew Mahmud , who overthrew the Safavid Shah and established his own rule over Iran. Mahmud in turn was succeeded by his cousin Ashraf following a palace coup in 1725. Ashraf also did not retain his throne for long, as the Iranian conqueror Nader-Qoli Beg (later Shah ), under the resurgent Safavid banner, defeated him at the Battle of Damghan in 1729. Ashraf Hotak was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan, limiting Hotak rule to just a small corner of their once large empire. Hotak rule came to an end in 1738, when Nader Shah defeated Ashraf's successor Hussain Hotak after the lengthy siege of Kandahar . Subsequently, Nader Shah began re-establishing Iranian suzerainty over regions lost to Iran's archrivals, the Ottoman and Russian Empires , decades earlier.",

          "text": "After a long pursuit, Abu Yazid was finally cornered and captured, before dying of his injuries on 19 August 947. After Abu Yazid's death, al-Mansur publicly proclaimed his caliphate. His victory over Abu Yazid was celebrated as a triumph over a 'False Messiah', and as heralding a new beginning for the dynasty and its divine mission. Al-Mansur spent the remainder of his reign in al-Mansuriya , a new capital city he founded in 948. During his reign, he also secured the allegiance of the Sanhaja Berbers under Ziri ibn Manad , recaptured Tahert from the rebellious Miknasa Berbers, suppressed a revolt in the overseas Fatimid province of Sicily , launched naval raids against Byzantine holdings in southern Italy , and engaged in a mounting antagonism with the rival Umayyad state of Córdoba . Early life and accession [ edit ] The future al-Mansur was born Isma'il, in early January 914, in the palace city of Raqqada near Kairouan . He was the son of the then heir-apparent and future second Fatimid imam – caliph , Muhammad al-Qa'im bi-Amr Allah ( r. 934–946 ), and a local slave concubine , Karima, who had once belonged to the last Aghlabid emir of Ifriqiya, Ziyadat Allah III . Isma'il was not the oldest son of al-Qa'im, but the firstborn, al-Qasim, reportedly predeceased his father. According to the official version of events, on 12 April 946, al-Qa'im publicly proclaimed Isma'il as his heir, with the regnal name of al-Mansur Billah, and when he died on 17 May, al-Mansur became imam and caliph.",

Military actions at the Siegfried Line up to 15 December alone brought death, injury or captivity to more than 250,000 soldiers from both sides. The First and Ninth U.S. Army suffered 57,039 battle casualties (dead, wounded, captured, missing in action); 71,654 non-battle casualties, i.e. accidents, diseases such as pneumonia , trench foot , frostbite , and trauma . German Armed Forces are presumed to be 12,000 dead, 95,000 captured (documented), and an unknown number of wounded. On 16 December 1944, German forces began the Ardennes Offensive, more commonly known as the Battle of the Bulge and as a result further fighting in the Hürtgen ended. Aftermath [ edit ] A U.S. half-track of the 16th Infantry Regiment /1st U.S. Division in the Hürtgen Forest, 15 February 1945 The Battle of Hürtgen Forest has been referred to as a stalemate that consumed large amounts of resources on both sides. The Americans suffered 33,000 casualties during the course of the battle which ranged up to 55,000 casualties, included 9,000 non-combat losses and represented a 25 percent casualty rate. The Germans had also suffered heavy losses with 28,000 casualties—many of these were non-combatants and prisoners of war . The surprise German Ardennes offensive caught Allied forces off guard. The Germans attacked with nearly 30 divisions; including the elite 1st SS , 2nd SS , and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions, with the northernmost point of the battlefront centered on Monschau .",

The Battle of Hürtgen Forest ( German : Schlacht im Hürtgenwald ) was a series of battles fought from 19 September to 16 December 1944, between American and German forces on the Western Front during World War II , in the Hürtgen Forest , a 140 km (54 mi ) area about 5 km (3.1 mi) east of the Belgian–German border. Lasting 88 days, it was the longest battle on German ground during World War II and it is the second longest single battle the U.S. Army has ever fought after the three-month-long Battle of Bataan . The U.S. commanders' initial goal was to pin down German forces in the area to keep them from reinforcing the front lines farther north in the Battle of Aachen , where the US forces were fighting against the Siegfried Line network of fortified industrial towns and villages speckled with pillboxes , tank traps, and minefields. The Americans' initial tactical objectives were to take the village of Schmidt and clear Monschau . In a second phase the Allies wanted to advance to the Rur River as part of Operation Queen . Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model intended to bring the Allied thrust to a standstill. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of units than at the Battle of Arnhem , he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties, and taking full advantage of the fortifications the Germans called the Westwall , better known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line.

They were married for 47 years, and had one son, George Westinghouse III, who in turn had six children. From 1871, George and Marguerite Westinghouse maintained a large home in Pittsburgh called Solitude, building up from an existing house on land purchased by George in 1871. They were part of a social class of very rich local industrialists and money managers including neighbors and associates Henry Clay Frick , Henry J. Heinz , William Thaw , Andrew Mellon , and Richard Beatty Mellon , and the brothers Andrew Carnegie and Thomas Carnegie . Their guests included Nicola Tesla , Lord Kelvin , and congressman (and future president) William McKinley . By 1893, they had constructed Erskine Park in Lenox, Massachusetts , which they used as a summer home, in part as a respite from the gritty industrial environment of Pittsburgh. It was named for the family of Marguerite's grandparents. In 1898, the Westinghouses leased and then in 1901 purchased the Blaine House mansion in Washington D.C. Marguerite Westinghouse was reputed to host frequent and lavish entertainments there. In 1918, their former Pittsburgh home, Solitude, was razed and the land given to the City of Pittsburgh to establish Westinghouse Park .

The Worth and High Street conservation areas also reflect the importance of the ancient features, buildings, townscapes and open space which survive from the medieval era and earlier in those parts of the borough. Worth's church, St Nicholas' , is a \"remarkable example of a pre- Conquest building\" with a 10th- or 11th-century cruciform layout and apsidal east end. On the approach to it are 17th-century buildings of traditional local materials such as Street House (a former inn) and a timber-and-stone lychgate . Several other old houses, a moat and ancient trees contribute to the setting of the village, which until the late 20th century was still rural and isolated but which has now been surrounded by urban development (including, at close quarters, the M23 motorway ). Crawley High Street, the natural halfway point between London and the fashionable seaside resort of Brighton , has been important since King John granted a charter for a weekly market there in 1202. No buildings of that antiquity survive, but St John the Baptist's Church (part of the High Street conservation area, although set back along a narrow path) has 14th-century fabric. Surviving medieval and later buildings, some of which are timber-framed hall houses , include the Ancient Priors , the Old Punch Bowl , Tree House , the Brewery Shades , the George Hotel (\"Crawley's most celebrated building\") and the White Hart Inn .",

After attending the solemn mass in the temple of the sanctuary, the king inaugurated the new Royal Chapel that was placed under his protection, as shown by the inclusion of his coat of arms on the altarpiece. The blessing of the chapel was carried out by Cardinal Vicente Enrique y Tarancón , a person closely linked to the city and a native of neighboring Burriana . Juan Carlos I, accompanied by Queen Sofia , had already visited the Sanctuary of St. Paschal on December 2, 1976. Previously, the kings of the House of Hadsburg , Philip III , accompanied by his wife Margaret of Austria , and Philip IV , accompanied by Prince Balthasar Charles of Austria , had visited the sanctuary. The House of Bourbon also visited the sanctuary in the past. In the 18th century it was visited by Charles III of Spain and his wife Maria Amalia of Saxony . In 1802 it was visited by Charles IV of Spain , his wife Maria Luisa of Parma , the then Infante Ferdinand , the Etrurian King Louis I , his wife Maria Luisa of Spain and the Prime Minister of Spain, Godoy .

Due to the popularity of the sport, there are a multitude of governing bodies such as the United States Specialty Sports Association , International Softball Congress and the National Softball Association . The WBSC holds the Women's Softball World Cup tournaments in several categories. The tournament in each category is held every four years—two years from 2010. The most recent tournament was XII Women's World Championship in June, 2010. All World Championships use a Page playoff system and are in fastpitch. There are also several World Cups held at 4-year intervals in different categories. New Zealand became the Men's World Champions winning the world title in 2013. Prior to that, Australia won the World Championship in 2009 and New Zealand had won the previous three tournaments before that. In the Junior Men's World Champions in 2012, Team Argentina won the world title. Summer Olympics [ edit ] In the Women's Softball World Cup the United States is the most dominant team, having won three of the past four Olympic tournaments and the past seven World Championships. The current Junior Women's World Champion is the United States. Women's softball debuted at the 1996 Summer Olympics and was removed from the program following the 2008 Summer Olympics . Softball and Baseball were unable to have their sport included in the program at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics . In 2012 the heads of the International Softball and Baseball Federations announced their united effort to be included in the program in 2020. \"The proposal calls for men's baseball and women's softball to be played at a single venue during 7 to 10 days. Each tournament would feature eight teams. Baseball and softball would be two disciplines under a single sports banner.",

          "text": "\"The proposal calls for men's baseball and women's softball to be played at a single venue during 7 to 10 days. Each tournament would feature eight teams. Baseball and softball would be two disciplines under a single sports banner. The proposal awaits formal endorsement from the congress of both federations. Other sports which sought to be included in the 2020 program, when only one spot is up for filling, were: karate, roller sports, squash, sports climbing, wakeboard and wushu. The IOC executive board were to decide at their May meeting which sport to recommend for inclusion. The final decision was made in a vote of the full IOC in Buenos Aires in September 2013. Softball and Baseball were re-included in the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020, which was held in 2021. The American team had entered the gold medal match with an undefeated record, facing Japan. United States was defeated 2–0 by Japan, naming Japan the Tokyo 2020 Softball Olympic Gold Medalists. Softball was not included in the 2024 Summer Olympics but is expected to return for the 2028 Summer Olympics . Even though the 2028 Summer Olympics will be held in LA, the softball and baseball events will be held in Oklahoma. Participating countries and areas [ edit ] New Zealand [ edit ] New Zealand is the most successful nation at men's world championship softball, having won their eighth title in 2019. The New Zealand women's team have also won a number of World Championship titles in the past. The game is widely played in New Zealand and is the second most popular summer sport behind cricket . Australia [ edit ] Main article: Softball in Australia Softball is played in all states and territories in Australia and at all levels of academic education.

          "text": "While not being urged to avoid competition, women had few opportunities to compete in sport in Australia until the 1880s. After that point, new sporting facilities were being built around the country and many new sport clubs were created. During the 1900s in Australia, lacrosse became more socially acceptable for women to participate in. Subsequently, female participation rates rose in places like Queensland . In 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for medical reasons, some girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Soccer was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. Sports which were medically appropriate for all girls, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, were swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding. Australian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II . Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and had held competitions during the war. This structure survived in the post-war period. Women's sports were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.

          "text": "In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times , Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history. In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act. Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden , Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic, but called for increased restrictions on the National Security Agency (NSA) to address violations of privacy. Obama continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W. Bush, while implementing some reforms. He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA's ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). Racial issues See also: Race and ethnicity in the United States In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era. Following Obama's election, many pondered the existence of a \" post-racial America \". However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama. The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the killing of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he said that \"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\" The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri , sparked a wave of protests . These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people . Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.",

The Cup final appearance raised hopes that the club could win a trophy the following season but a change to the offside rule during the off-season, reducing the number of players required between an attacker and the net, proved difficult to adapt to for Cardiff's defence and they finished in 16th place. The disappointing start to the season led Fred Stewart to revamp the playing squad, including selling long-serving forward Jimmy Gill to Blackpool for £3,200 in the opening months of the campaign.

Partial league table [ edit ] Main article: 1924–25 Football League § First Division Source: Rules for classification: 1) Points; 2) Goal average; 3) Goals scored Match results [ edit ] Key Results Cup matches [ edit ] FA Cup [ edit ] Cardiff entered the FA Cup in the first round and were drawn against Third Division North side Darlington . Despite being considered heavy favourites, Cardiff could only manage a goalless draw in a result that was regarded as one of the surprise results of the round, with the home side being jeered off the pitch by their own supporters. The result was partly blamed on the substandard condition of the pitch at Cardiff's Ninian Park ground, with the surface being noted for its \"deadness that made accurate passing impossible\". The two teams met in a replay four days later where the pitch at Darlington's home ground, Feethams , also drew criticism with Cardiff players being quoted as saying the pitch was \"worse than Ninian Park had ever been\". The teams played out a second goalless draw necessitating a second replay, held at Anfield in Liverpool. Their lower ranked opponents created several scoring opportunities in the opening stages of the match but were unable to convert any, hitting the crossbar twice. Early in the second half, Cardiff took the lead when Beadles' shot rebounded off the crossbar allowing Len Davies to open the scoring. Willie Davies added a second later in the half as the match finished 2–0. In the second round, Cardiff were drawn against Fulham . The match was played in difficult conditions with The Times stating that the heavy rainfall meant that \"good football was out of the question\". The rapidly deteriorating pitch led the referee to halt the game for ten minutes before both sides agreed to continue play with Len Davies scoring the only goal of the match.",

          "text": "Although the side ultimately missed out on the league title, their second-placed finish saw ticket sales increase greatly ahead of the new season with both the Grange and Canton stands being sold out and the rest of the ground largely full. Manager Fred Stewart , who was entering his tenth competitive season in charge, made several changes to his playing squad with ten players being signed. Harry Beadles had arrived at the club from Liverpool immediately following the end of the previous season and had been part of the club's overseas tour. He had previously had a trial at the club after the First World War which had proved unsuccessful. Several players from local teams were also brought in, including forwards Jack Nicholls , son of Cardiff director Sydney Nicholls who was signed from Newport County , and Willie Davies , signed from Swansea Town for £2,500. The club also signed Joe Nicholson from Clapton Orient and Tom Sloan from Linfield , as well as James McLean from amateur side Barn Athletic, a player who was regarded as deaf and dumb although he never played for the first team. The pitch at the club's home ground, Ninian Park , was overhauled with several tons of sand, soil and grass seeds lain ahead of the campaign after criticism of the playing surface. In the early stages of the season, Cardiff hired noted seed experts Sutton & Co to advise on ways of improving the playing surface. First Division [ edit ] Cardiff started the season with a goalless draw away to Burnley on 30 August 1924 and a 1–1 draw with Sheffield United two days later. Cardiff were one of several to begin the season slowly, including FA Cup holders Newcastle United , with The Times reporting that the expectant teams' \"preconceived ideas have been rudely shaken\".",

Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball before the 2021 season in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. As a result, the Midwest League disbanded and the Timber Rattlers were elevated to the High-A classification and placed in the High-A Central , where they continued their affiliation with Milwaukee. Wisconsin began competition in the new league on May 4 with a 2–1 victory over the Beloit Snappers at Fox Cities Stadium. They ended the season in third place in the West Division with a 59–60 record. In 2022, the High-A Central became known as the Midwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. Wisconsin placed second in both halves of the split-season, missing out on qualifying for the postseason. Their season record was 69–60. They did not win either half of the 2023 season in which they finished 62–68. The Timber Rattlers won the first-half of the 2024 season with a record of 42–44, clinching a spot in the playoffs. They won the Western Division title over the Quad Cities River Bandits , 2–0, but were defeated in the championship series by the Lake County Captains , 2–1. Wisconsin posted a season record of 77–54. Victor Estevez won the Midwest League Manager of the Year Award.

          "text": "Baseball player Janice Winifred O'Hara [״Jenny״] (November 30, 1918 – March 7, 2001) was a pitcher and utility who played from 1943 through 1949 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Listed at 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m), 122 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Janice O'Hara was one of the sixty original players to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for its inaugural season. A valuable and versatile player, she had an array of pitches that kept the hitters guessing, and also played several positions competently during her seven years in the league. Born in Beardstown, Illinois , O'Hara started playing organized softball in Springfield in her teen years, until AAGPBL scout Eddie Stumpf interviewed her and sent her to the final tryout at Wrigley Field in Chicago . In the process, she signed a contract and joined the Kenosha Comets , playing for them her entire career in the league. Comets manager Josh Billings used O'Hara at first base and she hit a respectable .187 average and posted career-numbers in hits (63), triples (6), runs (46) and RBI (28), helping Kenosha win the second half of the 1943 season. The team faced first-half winner Racine Belles in the best-of-five series and was shut out in three games. By 1944, new manager Marty McManus turned O'Hara into a utility player. She collected a personal-high 37 stolen bases and belted the only home run of her career in that season. After that, she mostly played at first base and in the outfield , but also filled in at second base and third base through the 1946 season.",

All those executed were members of WiN who, during World War II , took an active part in anti-Nazi resistance. Main gate of prison The executed men were: Łukasz Ciepliński , Karol Chmiel , Adam Lazarowicz , Józef Rzepka , Józef Batory , Mieczysław Kawalec and Franciszek Błażej . All of the men were apprehended in late 1947 and early 1948, and almost all came from the Rzeszów area. They were personally chosen to take part in the anti-Communist resistance by Ciepliński, commanding officer of the WiN's 4th Headquarters, who chose them because of their moral fortitude and their unbroken spirit. The interrogations conducted by Communist investigators that ensued were particularly brutal. All seven were tortured and severely beaten. Cieplinski's legs and hands were broken, and he had to be carried by his fellows for meals in a blanket. A staged trial that took place on October 5, 1950, was led by a group of ruthless military prosecutors from the Warsaw Military District—Colonel Aleksander Warecki (real name Warenhaupt, who served as the presiding judge), Major Zbigniew Furtak , Major Zbigniew Trylinski and Lt. Col. Jerzy Tramer , who served as the Public Prosecutor.",

She took comfort in having frightened such a powerful figure of the Tsarist autocracy . When Izmailovich and Pulikhov made their final statements, they focused on the killings of 18 October 1905. In his own final statement, the prosecutor requested capital punishment . After a few minutes of deliberation, the judges found Izmailovich and Pulikhov guilty of the charges of conspiracy to murder and sentenced them to execution by hanging . Before they could be led out of the courtroom, Izmailovich asked to give testimony in the trial of the baker's assistant. The judge agreed and she testified that he had nothing to do with the assassination, that he was not a member of their political party, and that she knew the real name of the bomb thrower. When asked for the name, she said his given name was \"Samson\", but that she did not know his family name. The judge disregarded her testimony and she was led out of the room. As she passed her sisters, Mariya told her that she did not believe she would be hanged. Izmailovich reported that she and Pulikhov were not afraid of death, as they believed they were dying for a good cause. At 16:00, they were taken out of the Artillery Corps headquarters and taken back to the prison by the Cossacks. On the way, Izmailovich noticed people watching her from windows, smiling and waving at her. When they arrived at the prison, Pulikhov and Izmailovich embraced for the last time. Pulikhov told Izmailovich that he was happy to die for socialism, but told her to live. He said that his last thought would be of her and her sister.",

          "text": "Fellini vigorously responded to this criticism: \"Certain people still think neorealism is fit to show only certain kinds of reality, and they insist that this is social reality. It is a program, to show only certain aspects of life\". Film critic Millicent Marcus wrote that \" La Strada remains a film indifferent to the social and historical concerns of orthodox neorealism\". Soon, other Italian filmmakers, including Michelangelo Antonioni and even Fellini's mentor and early collaborator Roberto Rossellini were to follow Fellini's lead and, in the words of critic Peter Bondanella , \"pass beyond a dogmatic approach to social reality, dealing poetically with other equally compelling personal or emotional problems\". As film scholar Mark Shiel has pointed out, when it won the first Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1957, La Strada became the first film to win international success as an example of a new brand of neorealism, \"bittersweet and self-conscious\". International film directors who have named La Strada as one of their favorite films include Stanley Kwan , Anton Corbijn , Gillies MacKinnon , Andreas Dresen , Jiří Menzel , Adoor Gopalakrishnan , Mike Newell , Rajko Grlić , Laila Pakalniņa , Ann Hui , Akira Kurosawa , Kazuhiro Soda , Julian Jarrold , Krzysztof Zanussi , and Andrey Konchalovsky . David Cronenberg credits La Strada for opening his eyes to the possibilities of cinema when, as a child, he saw adults leave a showing of the film openly weeping. The film has found its way into popular music, too. Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson have mentioned the film as an inspiration for their songs \" Mr.",

Other cancers [ edit ] Preclinical laboratory studies analogous to those conducted on the pro-malignant effects of 12( S )-HETE and growth-inhibiting effects of blocking 12-HETE production in cultured prostate cancer cell lines, have implicated 12-HETE (stereoisomer sometimes undefined) in cancer cell lines from various other human tissues including those from the liver, intestinal epithelium, lung, breast, skin ( melanoma ), ovary, pancrease, and possibly bladder. These studies implicate the interaction of 12-HETE with BLT2 receptors in intestinal epithelium cancer cells, and BLT2 receptors in breast, ovary, pancreas, and bladder cancer cells. While the studies on these tissues have not been as frequent or diverse as those on prostate cancer cell lines, they are suggested to indicate that 12-HETE contributes to the growth or spread of the corresponding cancer in humans. Diabetes [ edit ] 12(S)-HETE, 12( S )-HpETE, and with far less potency 12( R )-HETE reduced insulin secretion and caused apoptosis in cultured human pancreatic insulin -secreting beta cell lines and prepared pancreatic islets . TNFα , IL-1β , and IFNγ also reduced insulin secretion in cultured human pancreatic INS-1 beta cells, apparently by inducing the expression of NOX1 (NADPH oxidase 1) and thereby to the production of cell-toxic reactive oxygen species ; these cytokine effects were completely dependent on 12-lipoxygenase and mimicked by 12( S )-HETE but not 12( R )-HETE.",

Immunochemical analyses reveal that these cells generally express B-cell surface markers including the CD10 (60% of cases), CD20 , CD19 , CD22 , and CD79 but not CD5 , CD11c , or CD23 cell surface proteins; genomic analyses reveal that these cells contain t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation (85–90% of cases), 1p36 deletions (60–70% of cases), and with far less frequency the other genomic abnormalities listed in the above sections on Pathophysiology and Presentation and course. None of these protein markers or genomic abnormalities are diagnostic for FL, e.g. the t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation is found in 30% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in a small number of reactive benign lymph nodes. Rather, the diagnosis is made by a combination of histological, immunological, and genomic abnormalities. According to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, follicular lymphoma can be classified morphologically by the relative amount of centroblasts . However, such classification is optional, due to poor reproducibility and little difference in prognosis and treatment, except that a lymphoma with almost only centroblasts may be diagnosed as a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The optional classification of follicular lymphoma is as follows: Histologic comparison of cell types in a germinal center , H&E stain: - Centrocytes are small to medium size with angulated, elongated, cleaved, or twisted nuclei. - Centroblasts are larger cells containing vesicular nuclei with one to three basophilic nucleoli apposing the nuclear membrane.",

Colleen Murphy , an Oakland All American, and another one of Huth's outstanding swimmers on the women's 1994 Division II NCAA Championship team, became a career coach who would lead the swimming team at Truman State University to three successive NCAA championships between 2002-2005, and later coach swimming at the U.S. Air Force Academy beginning in 2012. Several athletes at Oakland during Huth's time at the University participated in the Olympics. Haitham Hazem , who swam for Oakland while Huth was an Oakland Athletic administrator, participated in the 2000 Olympics for the Egyptian Olympic team in the butterfly, IM and backstroke. Cheryl Angelelli who graduated Oakland University in 1993, was a paralympic swimmer and medalist in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics. There were no known Olympic participants in swimming who swam with Huth during his time as women's swim coach, but several male Olympic participants who swam for Oakland while Huth worked as a coach or administrator. Eric McIlquham, a 1992 graduate of Oakland, and a swimmer for the men's team, coached the Egyptian Olympic team in 1996 and 2000, and coached for the University of West Virginia. 1992 Oakland graduate Hilton Woods who swam for Coach Pete Hovland, represented the Netherlands Antilles in the 1988 Olympic Games and also participated in the 1984 Olympics.

          "text": "This period further enhanced the status of the Christians and eroded the power of authorities to protect the Jews. Before 1840, cases of blood libel occurred in Aleppo in 1810 and in Antioch in 1826. In 1840, contemporaneous with the affair in Rhodes, a case of blood libel known as the Damascus affair was developing in Damascus , while the city was under the short-lived control of Muhammad Ali of Egypt . On February 5, Capuchin friar Thomas and his servant Ibrahim Amara went missing, and the Jews of Damascus were accused of murdering them to collect their blood for Passover matzos. The local Christian community, the governor, and the French consul, who received full support from Paris, actively pursued the ritual murder charge. The Jews were tortured, and some of them confessed to having killed Father Thomas and his servant. Their testimonies were used by the accusers as the irrefutable proof of guilt. The case drew international attention, arousing active protests from the European Jewish diaspora. Accusation [ edit ] Disappearance [ edit ] On February 17, 1840, a boy from a Greek Orthodox family in Rhodes went for a walk and did not return. The next day his mother reported the disappearance to the Ottoman authorities. The island's governor, Yusuf Pasha , ordered a search, but several days' efforts proved fruitless. The European consuls pressed the governor to solve the case: the boy's family was Christian, though without foreign protection. The Greek Christian population of Rhodes, meanwhile, had no doubts that the boy had been murdered by the Jews for ritual purposes. An eyewitness reported: \"It was firmly believed that the child in question was doomed to be sacrificed by the Jews. The whole island was agitated from one end to the other.\" The assurance of the local Christians having been impressed upon the Ottoman authorities, they began searching the Jewish quarter, again in vain.",

He also supported Turkish nationalism against its Ottoman counterpart, along with secularism ( anti-clericalism or laicism) against theocracy . Frashëri was one of the sons of an impoverished bey from Frashër (Fraşer during Ottoman rule) in the District of Përmet . He gained a place in Ottoman literature as a talented author under the name of Şemseddin Sami Efendi and contributed to the Ottoman Turkish language reforms. Frashëri's message, however as declared in his book \"Albania - What it was, what it is, and what will become of it\" published in 1899, became the manifesto of the Albanian National Awakening. He discussed the prospects for a united, free and independent republic of Albania. In this way, beginning with a demand for autonomy and struggle for their own alphabet and education, Frashëri helped the Albanian National Movement develop its claim for independence. His lifetime goal, as that of many other members of the Albanian renaissance was the development and improvement of Albania's culture and eventual establishment of an independent country. Life [ edit ] Museum house of the Frashëri Brothers in Frashër, Përmet, Albania Sami Frashëri was born in 1850 in the village of Frashër in the Vilayet of Janina , Ottoman Empire (modern Albania ) to a distinguished Muslim Albanian family of Bektashi religious affiliations.",

Officials with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, speaking to BBC News on condition of anonymity, said they were aware of large-scale recruitment of Tuareg mercenaries in Mali by Gaddafi loyalists. One official said the government opposed the use of mercenaries and was considering options for preventing their export from the country. Meanwhile, the African Solidarity for Democracy and Independence opposition party has openly declared its support for Gaddafi, denouncing what it called \"the virulent media campaign of propaganda and disinformation\" against him and claiming Western countries want to control Libya's oil and install a puppet government . Mozambique – President Armando Guebuza condemned the violence in the Arab world, including Libya, calling it \"unacceptable\". Guebuza said that \"authorities should listen more to people\". Foreign Minister Oldemiro Baloi said four of seven Mozambicans in Libya were evacuated in late February, but the other three elected to remain in the country. Niger – The government said it was following events in Libya \"with great concern\" and was working with the Libyan government to get its citizens out of the country. In late March, it refused to allow citizens to rally in support of Gaddafi in Niamey , breaking with neighboring Mali over whether to allow pro-Gaddafi demonstrations. Niger has struggled to cope with an influx of perhaps over 10,000 refugees from Libya since the start of the conflict, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency . Nigeria – Nigeria voted for the UN resolution to establish a Libyan no-fly zone in its capacity as a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council on 17 March. On 23 August, Nigeria recognised the National Transitional Council, and it urged the AU to follow suit a day later.",

Chicago has a famous skyline that features many of the world's tallest buildings as well as the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District . The skyline is spaced out throughout the downtown area. The Willis Tower , formerly the Sears Tower, the third-tallest building in the Western Hemisphere (and still second-tallest by roof height), stands in the western Loop in the heart of the city's financial district, along with other buildings, such as 311 South Wacker Drive and the AT&T Corporate Center . Chicago's fourth-tallest building, the Aon Center , is just south of Illinois Center . The complex is at the east end of the Loop, east of Michigan Avenue . Two Prudential Plaza is also there, just west of the Aon Center. The Loop contains a wealth of outdoor sculpture, including works by Pablo Picasso , Joan Miró , Henry Moore , Marc Chagall , Magdalena Abakanowicz , Alexander Calder , and Jean Dubuffet . Chicago's cultural heavyweights, such as the Art Institute of Chicago , the Goodman Theatre , the Chicago Theatre , the Lyric Opera at the Civic Opera House building, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , are also in the area, as is the historic Palmer House Hilton hotel, on East Monroe Street. Chicago's waterfront, which is almost exclusively recreational beach and park areas from north to south, features Grant Park in the downtown area. Grant Park is the home of Buckingham Fountain , the Petrillo Music Shell , the Grant Park Symphony (where free concerts can be enjoyed throughout the summer), and Chicago's annual two-week food festival, the Taste of Chicago , where more than 3 million people try foods from over 70 vendors. The area also hosts the annual music festival Lollapalooza , which features popular alternative rock, heavy metal, EDM , hip hop, and punk rock artists.",

Despite years of public and private attempts to spur economic growth, urban decay and high poverty have long been widespread in this area, with many residents still living in former cigar workers' homes built almost a century ago. From 2000 to 2009, gentrification and redevelopment slowly began to spread to the current V.M. Ybor neighborhood located north and west of the Ybor City Historic District. During the period, the poverty rate in this area dropped from over 40% to about 13%. Most Tampa cigar factories were made of wood and by 2018, only two such structures remained: the Oliva factory, totally renovated and converted into apartments, and the Salvador Rodriguez Co. on 22nd St. S. in the Palmetto Beach area, now an office building. The local museum is the Ybor City Museum State Park in the former Ferlita Bakery building (originally La Joven Francesca) building on 9th Avenue.

There is another lake, Staro jezero (\"Old Lake\"), in the town itself. It is a remnant of the former river Galacka, part of the Mureș river system. The river was diverted at a time, partially channeled and conducted underground, so there is no river in Kikinda today. In the city, there is a park called Blandaš, which was declared a natural monument. The tree line along the 2 km (1.2 mi) long Generala Drapšina Street is made up of 400 trees, and the street was declared the 22nd most beautiful street in the world by the Architecture and Design magazine. The tree line was planted after the World War II, even before the war ended in the rest of Europe and Yugoslavia. It is believed that the seedlings were a gift from the U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt , due to his friendship with Mihajlo Pupin . In the vicinity of Kikinda is the Copper Age kurgan of Kinđa , which possibly gave name to the city.

Despite recovering from injury, Len Davies was left out of the side with Nicholson keeping his place. Around 92,000 spectators attended the final against Sheffield United at Wembley Stadium with the match dubbed \"The Jubilee Final\" as the 50th final in the competition's history. The match was deemed to be low on quality with The Times reporting that more than two-thirds of the final were \"never first-class.\" The decisive moment of the match came on the half hour mark when Cardiff half-back Harry Wake gave possession away cheaply to opposition forward Fred Tunstall who scored the only goal of the game. Fred Keenor later described the build up to the winning goal, commenting \"Wake was in possession of the ball and was facing his own goal when he turned to make a clearance. Tunstall, sizing up the position much quicker than any of our defence, raced in, robbed Wake on the turn, and after advancing about 10 yards shot into the corner of the net.\" Keenor though absolved his teammate of any blame in conceding the goal, adding \"Any blame must be shouldered by the rest of the defence, of which I was one. A warning shout should have been given of Tunstall's first approach.\" Match results [ edit ] Key Results Welsh Cup [ edit ] Cardiff entered the Welsh Cup in the fifth round, being drawn against South Wales rivals Swansea Town .

With two outs, the batter can attempt to run to first whether or not it is already occupied. Depending on the league in slow pitch only a foul ball with two strikes on the batter means the batter is out. Stealing in 16-inch softball is severely restricted, as a runner may only steal the base in front of them if it is open, and if they are thrown at, à la pickoff move or snap throw. This results in many inexperienced players being thrown or doubled off when they attempt to advance on a wild pickoff at another baserunner. Scoring runs [ edit ] A collision at home plate — the player in red scores as the catcher has failed to secure the ball. A \"run\" is scored when a player has touched all four bases in order, proceeding counterclockwise around them. They need not be touched on the same play; a batter may remain safely on a base while play proceeds and attempt to advance on a later play. A run is not scored if the last out is a force out or occurs during the same play that the runner crosses home plate. Ending the game [ edit ] The team with the most runs after seven innings wins the game. The last (bottom) half of the seventh inning or any remaining part of the seventh inning is not played if the team batting second is leading. If the game is tied, play usually continues until a decision is reached, by using the international tie-breaker rules. Starting in the top of first extra inning, the batting team starts with a baserunner on second base, which is the player who is the last available to bat (in other words, the batter who last took their position in the batter's box; regardless whether they were the last out or another runner was put out).",

The party proposed to change the name to \"The Center\" or \"The Alliance of the Center\" ( German : Die Mitte , CVP; French : Le Centre , PDC; Italian : il Centro , PPD; Romansh : il Center ) which is the name of the parliamentary group that the CVP shares with the other center-right parties, the Conservative Democratic Party of Switzerland and the Evangelical People's Party of Switzerland . The merger was ratified by a vote of the entire party in November 2020. Cantonal parties were not required to adopt the new name if they do not wish to do so. Pfister estimated that a new center-right party could obtain up to 20% of the vote in future elections. Platform [ edit ] In its party platform , the CVP described itself as a centrist party. The CVP fostered a social market economy in which a balance is struck between economic liberalism and social justice . The expansion of the party in the Protestant -dominated cantons, in which the CVP uphold rather centrist policies, stands in contrast to the traditional role of the CVP as the leading party in rather Catholic -dominated cantons of central Switzerland and the cantons of Valais . There, the electorate was mostly socially conservative . The CVP had three main policies in the political centre : The CVP uphold the social market economy . It supports exporting industries and more spending on education, research and development. It also aims at combating the black market and tax evasion. In order to increase efficiency and incentives, the CVP calls for the reduction and streamlining of bureaucratic procedures and government agencies, low taxation for family enterprises and those who offer vocational education and internships. The CVP calls for equal wages and job opportunities for both men and women.",

However, the clear CDU victory marked the beginning of a decline on both the federal level and in other states. This resulted in heavy losses for the SPD in Schleswig-Holstein , in North Rhine-Westphalia and, ultimately, in the 2017 German federal election .

          "text": "For promotional purposes, Orange Caramel performed \"Catallena\" on several South Korean music programs in 2014, including M! Countdown , Show! Music Core , and Inkigayo , where they dressed as various food items. Background and release [ edit ] Orange Caramel, the first sub-unit of South Korean girl group After School , had achieved mainstream success with hit singles such as \"Magic Girl\", \"Bangkok City\" and \"Shanghai Romance\" since their debut in 2010 as a three-member girl group. The group consisted of Raina , Nana and Lizzy . As one of the most-successful sub-unit groups, the trio are well known for their oddball and \"Candy Culture\" concepts. In late 2013, the group's record label, Pledis Entertainment , announced that Orange Caramel were preparing for a comeback the following February. However, the comeback was delayed until the beginning of March 2014. On 18 February of that year, the group posted a teaser on their official Facebook page, announcing the release of their third single, titled \"Catallena\". The teaser showed the leg of a woman hiding behind a pink wall, with her wearing a polka-dot styled vintage skirt, stockings and high-heels. It was followed by another teaser that was released two days later, which was based on a still-cut image from the then-upcoming music video . On 26 February 2014, the release date for the single was announced. It marked the group's first Korean release in 17 months since \" Lipstick \" in 2012, and their sixth single overall. \"Catallena\" was made available for digital download and streaming as a single in various countries through Pledis Entertainment and Kakao M on 12 March 2014. The physical CD single for the song was released in South Korea on 14 March 2014 by the aforementioned record labels.",

His final publication was made in 2012, entitled Kaa ze Ie Wayaje : An Annotated Dictionary of Kaw (Kanza) . Death and legacy [ edit ] After a years-long bout of prostate cancer and kidney disease , Rankin died on February 24, 2014, at the age of 75. Following his cremation, his wife called the Kaw Nation to inform them of his death and offer them his ashes. A spokesman for the Kaw, James Pepper Henry , remarked that Rankin had \"single-handed[ly] preserved our language\" and that \"the gift of Mr. Rankin's ashes is a high honor\". He was given a memorial headstone, which reads in Kansa: Wíblaha Ká ze íe shó sho ni ('Thanks to you, the Kansa language lives on'). He was also given the name Kaanze Koya ('Kaw Friend') by the Kaw Nation. Rankin has been described as a towering figure in Siouan linguistics. In a book posthumously dedicated in his honor, he was described by its editors as \"a mentor to nearly all living Siouanists\". The Sioux Nation made him an honorary citizen for his contributions to the preservation of their languages. Rankin's recordings of Kansa were given to some members of the tribe; Johnnie Ray McCauley, Rowe's nephew, received copies in 1996 and died a few months later while listening to Rankin's recordings of his aunt speaking the language. Personal life [ edit ] Rankin married Carolyn Ann Leverance on September 11, 1965. The two met while they were both students at the University of Chicago and were both later employed as researchers at the University of Kansas. Carolyn was a cellular biologist whose research focused on brain diseases relating to the Parkin protein .",

          "text": "Higher deflection angles allow a CRT of a given size to be slimmer, however they also impose more stress on the CRT envelope, specially on the panel, the seal between the panel and funnel and on the funnel. The funnel needs to be long enough to minimize stress, as a longer funnel can be better shaped to have lower stress. Comparison with other technologies [ edit ] Main article: Comparison of CRT, LCD, plasma, and OLED displays One of the defining points of comparison LCD advantages over CRT: Lower bulk, power consumption and heat generation, higher refresh rates (up to 360 Hz) CRT advantages over LCD: Better color reproduction, no motion blur, multisyncing available in many monitors, no input lag OLED advantages over CRT: Lower bulk, similar color reproduction, higher contrast ratios, similar refresh rates (over 60 Hz, up to 120 Hz) except for computer monitors. On CRTs, refresh rates depend on resolution, both of which are ultimately limited by the maximum horizontal scanning frequency of the CRT. Motion blur also depends on the decay time of the phosphors. Phosphors that decay too slowly for a given refresh rate may cause smearing or motion blur on the image. In practice, CRTs are limited to a refresh rate of 160 Hz. LCDs that can compete with OLED (Dual Layer, and mini-LED LCDs) are not available in high refresh rates, although quantum dot LCDs (QLEDs) are available in high refresh rates (up to 144 Hz) and are competitive in color reproduction with OLEDs. CRT monitors can still outperform LCD and OLED monitors in input lag, as there is no signal processing between the CRT and the display connector of the monitor, since CRT monitors often use VGA which provides an analog signal that can be fed to a CRT directly. Video cards designed for use with CRTs may have a RAMDAC to generate the analog signals needed by the CRT.",

More and more schools are motivating their students to live a different life and rethink every polluting step they may take. To prevent material from becoming waste, consumers, businesses, and non-profits must be educated in how to reduce waste and recycle successfully. The 5 R's of Bea Johnson [ edit ] Bea Johnson's 5R In the book Zero Waste Home: The Ultimate Guide to Simplifying your Life by Reducing your Waste the author, Bea Johnson, provides a modified version of the 3 Rs , the 5 Rs : Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rot to achieve Zero Waste at home. The method, which she developed through years of practicing waste free living and used to reduce her family's annual trash to fit in a pint jar, is now widely used by individuals, businesses and municipalities worldwide. Zero Waste Hierarchy [ edit ] The Zero Waste Hierarchy describes a progression of policies and strategies to support the zero-waste system, from highest and best to lowest use of materials. It is designed to be applicable to all audiences, from policymakers to industry and the individual. It aims to provide more depth to the internationally recognized 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle); to encourage policy, activity and investment at the top of the hierarchy; and to provide a guide for those who wish to develop systems or products that move us closer to zero waste. It enhances the zero-waste definition by providing guidance for planning and a way to evaluate proposed solutions. All over the world, in some form or another, a pollution prevention hierarchy is incorporated into recycling regulations, solid waste management plans, and resource conservation programs. In Canada, a pollution prevention hierarchy otherwise referred to as the Environmental Protection Hierarchy was adopted.",

          "text": "In the post-independence period, a number of Latin American countries sought to attract European immigrants as a source of labor as well as to deliberately change the proportions of racial and ethnic groups within their borders. Chile, Argentina, and Brazil actively recruited labor from Catholic southern Europe, where populations were poor and sought better economic opportunities. Many nineteenth-century immigrants went to the United States and Canada, but a significant number arrived in Latin America. Although Mexico tried to attract immigrants, it largely failed. As black slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888, coffee growers recruited Japanese migrants to work in coffee plantations. There is a significant population of Japanese descent in Brazil. Cuba and Peru recruited Chinese labor in the late nineteenth century. Some Chinese immigrants who were excluded from immigrating to the United States settled in northern Mexico. When the United States acquired its southwest by conquest in the Mexican–American War , Latin American populations did not cross the border to the United States, the border crossed them. In the twentieth century there have been several types of migration. One is the movement of rural populations within a given country to cities in search of work, causing many Latin American cities to grow significantly. Another is international movement of populations, often fleeing repression or war. Other international migration is for economic reasons, often unregulated or undocumented. Mexicans immigrated to the U.S. during the violence of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and the religious Cristero War (1926–29); during World War II, Mexican men worked in the U.S. in the bracero program . Economic migration from Mexico followed the crash of the Mexican economy in the 1980s. Spanish refugees fled to Mexico following the fascist victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936–38), with some 50,000 exiles finding refuge at the invitation of President Lázaro Cárdenas .",

He nonetheless devoted himself privately to Greek and followed the lectures of Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten , who coined the term \" aesthetics \". During this period, he became an enthusiastic translator of Herodotus . With the intention of becoming a physician, in 1740 Winckelmann attended medical classes at Jena . He also taught languages. From 1743 to 1748, he was the deputy headmaster of the gymnasium of Seehausen in the Altmark but Winckelmann felt that work with children was not his true calling. Moreover, his means were insufficient: his salary was so low that he had to rely on his students' parents for free meals. He was thus obliged to accept a tutorship near Magdeburg . Whilst working as a tutor for the powerful Lamprecht family, he fell into unrequited love with the handsome Lamprecht son. This was one of a series of such loves throughout his life. His enthusiasm for the male form excited Winckelmann's budding admiration of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. Count von Bünau's librarian [ edit ] In 1748, Winckelmann wrote to Count Heinrich von Bünau : \"[L]ittle value is set on Greek literature, to which I have devoted myself so far as I could penetrate, when good books are so scarce and expensive\". In the same year, Winckelmann was appointed secretary of von Bünau's library at Nöthnitz, near Dresden . The library contained some 40,000 volumes.",

He instructed the governor of Jamaica, Lord Windsor , to put military pressure on the Spaniards in order to retain the English presence in the region. ^ The hostilities led to the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667). ^ Mansvelt instead selected the more lucrative city of Cartago , the capital of Costa Rica, as the target for his attack. ^ Rogoziński points out that the erroneous report of Morgan's presence on Mansvelt's expedition was from Alexandre Exquemelin 's history The Buccaneers of America , although there is no record of Morgan's being part of Mansvelt's group. ^ The full name of the peso was the peso de ocho reales , also known as piece of eight or the Spanish dollar , the main currency used by the Spanish; English merchants and government used pounds, shillings and pence . In the late 17th century the peso was worth between five and six shillings. ^ Some sources, including Breverton and Allen, state that there were only ten survivors from a crew of 350; Pope states that more than 250 were killed. ^ For his failure in his action, Espinosa was arrested and sent back to Spain. ^ The size of Morgan's force differs between sources.",

The tribe traces its ancestry to Sheikh Isa al-Barzanji, who was the first to settle in Barzinjah in northern Iraq . Birth and early life [ edit ] Sheikh Muhammad al-Kasnazan al-Husayni was born in the village of Karbajna, which belongs to the subdistrict of Sinquar in Kirkuk Governorate , northern Iraq , at dawn on Friday, the 14th of the month of Safar in the year 1358 AH, corresponding to 15 April 1938 CE. This village where the Sheikh was born is the home of the sheikhs of the Kasnazani Order , and from his early years spent in Karbajna, the Sheikh of the Order was his father, Sheikh Abdul Karim al-Shah al-Kasnazan, who was entrusted with the leadership of the order by his elder brother Sultan Hussein al-Kasnazan, who was and still is referred to as \"The Sultan\". Sheikh Muhammad al-Kasnazan received the Sufi path (ṭarīqa) from his father, along with the sciences of Sufism , and he studied religious sciences under scholars at the Karbajna religious school. He studied Arabic and Islamic sciences under its scholars, including Mulla Kaka Hamma Sayf al-Din, Mulla Ali Mustafa (nicknamed Ali Laylan), and Mulla Abdullah Aziz al-Karbajani. Religious and Sufi education [ edit ] The Sheikh possessed a scholarly library containing thousands of books and manuscripts . He was a regular visitor to the Manuscript House, the Awqaf Public Library ( Baghdad ), and the library of the Qadiriyya Shrine.",

A number of Bedouin women mourned his death. Muhammad Ali took advantage of Al-Alfi's death to try to assert authority over the Bedouins. Two Ottoman era Mamluks, Iwaz Bey's Mamluk Yusuf Bey al-Jazzar and Jazzar Pasha were known for massacring Bedouins and given the name \"butcher\" (al-Jazzar) for it. After Muhammad Ali defeated the Mamluks and Bedouin, the Bedouin went on a destructive rampage against the Egyptian fellahin peasantry, destroying and looting crops and massacred 200 townsmen in Belbeis in Al-Sharqiya province and also rampaging through al-Qaliubiyya province.

Target of the airstrike [ edit ] Photograph of Shawqi Ali Ahmad al-Badani, the alleged target of the attack. A statement by Yemen's Supreme Security Committee said that the attack killed AQAP \"members and leaders who masterminded armed forces, police, and vital institutions.\" On 20 December, US and Yemeni officials told the Associated Press that the target of the attack was Shawqi Ali Ahmad al-Badani, a mid-level AQAP operational commander who was the mastermind of a major plot to attack an unspecified US embassy, which forced the closure of 19 diplomatic missions across the Middle East and North Africa in August of that year. An analyst from the Abaad Studies and Research Center said that Badani was being referred to on jihadist forums as an \"emir [leader] of Sanaa\", in the wake of the attack, but was effectively unheard of beforehand. Badani, who was listed as one of Yemen's most wanted militants several times, escaped the attack wounded according to the officials. By May 2014, US officials believed that he had escaped unharmed. He was added to the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list in July, and was killed by another drone strike in Radda on 3 November 2014. Witnesses and relatives of the victims in the attack denied any relation to Badani or his presence in the convoy. Baraa Shiban reported no signs that Badani was in the vicinity of the attack. He said that, as a native of Ibb , it would have been improbable for Badani to be invited to a small tribal wedding celebration in a region he was foreign to.",

For instance, T 3 contains five elements ((( ab ) c ) d ), (( ab )( cd )), (( a ( bc )) d ), ( a (( bc ) d )), and ( a ( b ( cd ))), with ((( ab ) c ) d ) < (( ab )( cd )) < ( a ( b ( cd ))) and ((( ab ) c ) d ) < (( a ( bc )) d ) < ( a (( bc ) d )) < ( a ( b ( cd ))). (The outermost pair of parentheses is redundant and often omitted when naming the elements of T n , as in the depiction of T 4 shown in the figure.) The number of elements in the Tamari lattice of order n is the n th Catalan number C n . Its Hasse diagram is isomorphic to the skeleton of the associahedron of dimension n-1 . The lattice property for the order (i.e., that any two bracketings have a join and meet ) is non-trivial and was first established rigorously by ( Friedman & Tamari 1967 ), with another simpler proof later given by ( Huang & Tamari 1972 ). The Tamari lattice can be described in several other equivalent ways: It is the poset of binary trees with n nodes and n +1 leaves, ordered by tree rotation operations. It is the poset of triangulations of a convex n -gon, ordered by flip operations that substitute one diagonal of the polygon for another.",

          "text": "Method of subtraction Complement numbers on an adding machine c. 1910. The smaller numbers, for use when subtracting, are the nines' complement of the larger numbers, which are used when adding. In mathematics and computing , the method of complements is a technique to encode a symmetric range of positive and negative integers in a way that they can use the same algorithm (or mechanism ) for addition throughout the whole range. For a given number of places half of the possible representations of numbers encode the positive numbers, the other half represents their respective additive inverses . The pairs of mutually additive inverse numbers are called complements . Thus subtraction of any number is implemented by adding its complement. Changing the sign of any number is encoded by generating its complement, which can be done by a very simple and efficient algorithm. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers . The generalized concept of the radix complement (as described below) is also valuable in number theory , such as in Midy's theorem . The nines' complement of a number given in decimal representation is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number y (the subtrahend ) from another number x (the minuend ) two methods may be used: In the first method, the nines' complement of x is added to y . Then the nines' complement of the result obtained is formed to produce the desired result. In the second method, the nines' complement of y is added to x and one is added to the sum. The leftmost digit '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the leftmost '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the tens' complement.",

They, for example, lead to the necessity of the fifth normal form in relational database design. The history of the argument also goes deeper, Condorcet's paradox perhaps being the first example of the finite sort. Pareto efficiency [ edit ] Main article: Pareto efficiency Definition [ edit ] A particular distribution of goods or outcome of any social process is regarded as Pareto-efficient if there is no way to improve one or more people's situations without harming another. Put another way, an outcome is not Pareto-efficient if there is a way to improve at least one person's situation without harming anyone else. For example, suppose a mother has ten dollars which she intends to give to her two children Carlos and Shannon. Suppose the children each want only money, and they do not get jealous of one another. The following distributions are Pareto-efficient: However, a distribution where the mother gives each of them $2 and wastes the remaining $6 is not Pareto-efficient, because she could have given the wasted money to either child and made that child better off without harming the other. In this example, it was presumed that a child was made better or worse off by gaining or losing money, respectively, and that neither child gained or lost by evaluating her share in comparison to the other. To be more precise, we must evaluate all possible preferences that the child might have and consider a situation as Pareto-efficient if there is no other social state that at least one person favors (or prefers) and no one disfavors. Use in economics [ edit ] Pareto efficiency is often used in economics as a minimal sense of economic efficiency . If a mechanism does not result in Pareto-efficient outcomes, it is regarded as inefficient, since there was another outcome that could have made some people better off without harming anyone else.",

It was first named in 1902, and was subsequently recognized as a separate species in 1935 from its closest relative, the living fossa ( Cryptoprocta ferox ). C. spelea was larger than its extant relative but otherwise similar. The two have not always been recognized as distinct species. When and how C. spelea became extinct remains unknown; however, some anecdotal evidence—including reports of unusually large fossas—suggests that more than one species may still survive. The species is known from subfossil bones found in a variety of caves in northern, western, southern, and central Madagascar. In some sites, it occurs with remains of C. ferox , but there is no evidence that the two lived in the same places at the same time. Living species of comparably sized, related carnivores in other regions are able to coexist, suggesting that C. spelea and C. ferox may have done the same. Due to its larger size, C. spelea likely preyed on animals too large for its smaller relative, including the recently extinct giant lemurs . Taxonomy [ edit ] In 1902, Guillaume Grandidier listed subfossil carnivoran remains from two caves on Madagascar as a larger \"variety\" of the living fossa ( Cryptoprocta ferox ), C. ferox var. spelea , without a detailed description or holotype designation. In 1935, Gabriel Petit considered spelea to represent a distinct species, but did not assign any specimen as the holotype.",

          "text": "Species of amphibian Xenohyla truncata , the Izecksohn's Brazilian treefrog , is a species of frugivorous tree frog in the family Hylidae . It is endemic to the State of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . The range of this frog ranges from the southern border of Espírito Santo down to Ilha da Marambaia, inhabiting mostly restingas near the coast and on some islands. They shelter inside bromeliads such as Neoregelia cruenta during the day and breed in temporary pools . When disturbed, this tree frog will tilt its head down, outstretch its legs, and puff up. This posture breaks up the frogs outline and makes it appear larger. These tree frogs are listed as near threatened because they are restricted to an area of less than 20,000 square kilometres and because human development modifies or destroys their restinga habitats. As a juvenile, Xenohyla truncata has white stripes down the sides of its body but they disappear at maturity, leaving the adult frog a uniform brown or orange. This species of frog is unique in that it is the only known frugivorous frog in the world. This frog will eat various types of plants, including Anthurium harrisii , Erythroxylum ovalifolium , and Maytenus obtusifolia . Inside the stomach contents of Xenohyla truncata were found many different types of arthropods , fruits , seeds , pods , pulp and flowers . The amount of plant material eaten by the frog likely depends on the blooming and fruiting periods of the plants, with various types of arthropods eaten instead when plants are unavailable. The frog will locate the fruit and simply snap at it, swallowing it whole. The frog has been found to defecate viable seeds and likely helps in the spread of the plants it consumes.",

          "text": "Lamberton recognized a third species, Cryptoprocta antamba , on the basis of a mandible (lower jaw) with abnormally broad spacing between the condyloid processes at the back. He also referred two femora (upper leg bones) and a tibia (lower leg bone) intermediate in size between C. spelea and C. ferox to this species. The specific name refers to the \"antamba\", an animal allegedly from southern Madagascar described by Étienne de Flacourt in 1658 as a large, rare, leopard-like carnivore that eats men and calves and lives in remote mountainous areas; it may have been the giant fossa. Goodman and colleagues could not locate Lamberton's material of Cryptoprocta antamba , but suggested that it was based on an abnormal C. spelea . Together, the fossa and C. spelea form the genus Cryptoprocta within the family Eupleridae , which also includes the other Malagasy carnivorans —the falanouc , the fanalokas , and the Galidiinae . DNA sequence studies suggest that the Eupleridae form a single natural ( monophyletic ) group and are most closely related to the mongooses of Eurasia and mainland Africa. Description [ edit ] Hypothetical life restoration Although some morphological differences between the two fossa species have been described, these may be allometric (growth-related), and in their 1986 Mammalian Species account of the fossa, Michael Köhncke and Klaus Leonhardt wrote that the two were morphologically identical. However, remains of C. spelea are larger than any living C. ferox . Goodman and colleagues found that spelea were 1.07 to 1.32 times as large as in adult C. ferox , and postcranial measurements were 1.19 to 1.37 times as large.",

Although the Type 34 was available in most countries, it was not offered officially in the U.S. – VW's largest and most important export market – another reason for its low sales numbers. Nevertheless, many made their way to the USA (most via Canada), and the USA now has the largest number of known Type 34s left in the world (400 of the total 1,500 to 2,000 or so remaining). Like the earlier Type 14, the Type 34 was styled by the Italian design studio Ghia. There are some similar styling influences, but the Type 34 Ghia looks very different from the Type 14. The chassis is also a major difference between the cars; the Type 14 shares its chassis with a Beetle (though with a wider floorpan), whereas the Type 34 body is mounted on a Type 3 floorpan and drivetrain (the same as a 1500/1600 Notchback, Fastback or Variant (Squareback)) – all featuring the 1500 'pancake' engine that allowed a front and rear boot. This makes the Type 34 mechanically the same as other Type 3s. However, all bodywork and bumpers, the interior, glass, and most of the lenses are all unique to the Type 34. The car has wider 6.00-15 crossply tyres, until 1968 when they moved to 165R15 Pirelli Cinturato.",

Type IIb, which is anaerobic, glycolytic , \"white\" muscle that is even less dense in mitochondria and myoglobin. In small animals like rodents, this is the major fast muscle type, explaining the pale color of their flesh. In laboratory house mice, an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism in the Myosin heavy polypeptide 4 gene causes a great reduction in the amount of Type IIb muscle, yielding the \"Mini-Muscle\" phenotype, which was discovered based on its greatly reduced (~50%) hind-limb muscle mass. The density of mammalian skeletal muscle tissue is about 1.06 kg/liter. This can be contrasted with the density of adipose tissue (fat), which is 0.9196 kg/liter. This makes muscle tissue approximately 15% denser than fat tissue. Skeletal muscle is a highly oxygen-consuming tissue, and oxidative DNA damage that is induced by reactive oxygen species tends to accumulate with age . The oxidative DNA damage 8-OHdG accumulates in heart and skeletal muscle of both mouse and rat with age. Also, DNA double-strand breaks accumulate with age in the skeletal muscle of mice.

          "text": "Thus, Locke uses a discussion of language to demonstrate sloppy thinking, following the Port-Royal Logique (1662) in numbering among the abuses of language those that he calls \"affected obscurity\" in chapter 10. Locke complains that such obscurity is caused by, for example, philosophers who, to confuse their readers, invoke old terms and give them unexpected meanings or who construct new terms without clearly defining their intent. Writers may also invent such obfuscation to make themselves appear more educated or their ideas more complicated and nuanced or erudite than they actually are. Book IV [ edit ] This book focuses on knowledge in general—that it can be thought of as the sum of ideas and perceptions . Locke discusses the limit of human knowledge , and whether such can be said to be accurate or truthful. Thus, there is a distinction between what an individual might claim to know , as part of a system of knowledge, and whether or not that claimed knowledge is actual. Locke writes at the beginning of the fourth chapter (\"Of the Reality of Knowledge\"): I doubt not but my Reader by this Time may be apt to think that I have been all this while only building a Castle in the Air; and be ready to say to me, To what purpose all this stir? Knowledge, say you, is only the Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of our own Ideas: but who knows what those Ideas may be?… But of what use is all this fine Knowledge of Men's own Imaginations, to a Man that enquires after the reality of things? It matters not what Men's Fancies are, 'tis the Knowledge of Things that is only to be priz'd; 'tis this alone gives a Value to our Reasonings, and Preference to one Man's Knowledge over another's, that it is of Things as they really are, and not of Dreams and Fancies.",

          "text": "O. C. Darley . So great was its popularity that the publisher asked for a second series or a sequel. But Dodge, meantime, had begun work upon a longer narrative. Like the rest of the reading world, she had been thrilled and fascinated by the lately-published histories of John Lothrop Motley , the Rise of the Dutch Republic , and the History of the United Netherlands . She resolved to make the Netherlands the scene of a juvenile tale, and give the youngsters so much of the history of that country as should tell itself, naturally, through the evolution of the story. She was really improvising it as a \"good-night story\" for her boys – making it up as she went along. In the heat of kindled imagination, she began to tell her children a story of life in the Netherlands , weaving into it much interesting material from the history of that country, which at that time she had never seen. The subject grew more and more absorbing to her. She worked upon the manuscript from morning till night, and sought every source of information which could make her pages more true to life or more entertaining to her readers. She ransacked libraries for books upon the Netherlands; made every traveler whom she knew tell her his tale of that country; and submitted every chapter to the test of the criticism of two accomplished Dutchmen living near her. Upon receiving the manuscript, the publisher, disappointed at not receiving a second collection of short stories, was tempted to reject it. But the author had nothing else ready, he could not afford to forego the prestige of her former success, and so, reluctantly and doubtfully, he issued the most successful juvenile tale of that time, Hans Brinker, or the Silver Skates (1865). It became an instant bestseller and was translated into French, German , Dutch , Russian , and Italian . The French Academy awarded it one of the Montyon Prizes of fifteen hundred francs.",

Intuitively, Pareto optimality captures an aspect of collective efficiency: the social choice is made so that everyone is collectively as well off as possible, to the extent that every available tradeoff would make someone worse off. Minimal liberalism (individual freedom): More than one individual in the society is decisive on a pair of social outcomes. (An individual is decisive on a pair of social outcomes x and y if, whenever they prefer x over y , the social choice function prefers x over y regardless of what other members of the society prefer. And similarly whenever they prefer y over x , the social choice function prefers y over x .) Formally, a social choice function F respects minimal liberalism if there is more than one individual i ∊ N for which there exists a pair of outcomes x i , y i on which they are decisive—that is, for every configuration of preference relations p ∊ Rel(X) , y i ∊ F(p) only when x i ≼ i y i (and similarly, x i ∊ F(p) only when y i ≼ i x i ). As an example of decisiveness: in the Lewd/Prude case, Lewd was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨\"Lewd reads\", \"No one reads\"⟩ and Prude was decisive on the pair of outcomes ⟨\"Prude reads\", \"No one reads\"⟩. Intuitively, minimal liberalism captures an aspect of individual freedom: for some issues, if you prefer x over y (or vice versa), then society respects your preference for x over y even if everyone else is against you.",

Their first published book, 1890's The Bondman , was a huge success in the United Kingdom and launched the company. He was joined in 1893 by Sydney Pawling . Heinemann died in 1920 and Pawling sold the company to Doubleday , having worked with them in the past to publish their works in the United States. Pawling died in 1922 and new management took over. Doubleday sold his interest in 1933. Through the 1920s, the company was well known for publishing works by famous authors that had previously been published as serials . Among these were works by H. G. Wells , Rudyard Kipling , W. Somerset Maugham , George Moore , Max Beerbohm and Henry James , among others. This attracted new authors to publish their first editions with the company, including Graham Greene , Edward Upward , J. B. Priestley and Vita Sackville-West . Throughout, the company was also known for its classics and international catalogue, and in the post-WWII era, the company focused on educational materials. Through the 1950s, the company was slowly taken over by Tilling Group 's investment arm. In 1953 they opened offices in The Hague for sales in continental Europe, and in 1978 they opened a separate company in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to sell their educational works in the US market. When Tilling was purchased by BTR plc in 1983, BTR sold off all their non-industrial assets; Heinemann was sold to Octopus Publishing Group . Octopus merged with Reed International (later Reed Elsevier) in 1987, who then sold their entire trade-oriented publishing assets to Random House in 1997.",

It was a modest muslin-covered duodecimo , with three or four illustrations by F. O. C. Darley . So great was its popularity that the publisher asked for a second series or a sequel. But Dodge, meantime, had begun work upon a longer narrative.",

          "text": "History [ edit ] Jesuit missionaries had to write annual reports to their superior in Québec or Montréal as an account of their activities. Annually, between 1632 and 1673, the superior compiled a narrative or \"Relation\" of the most important events which had occurred in the several missionary districts under his charge, sometimes using the exact words of the missionaries and sometimes summarizing the individual journals in a general account, based in part also upon the oral reports of visiting fathers. This annual \"Relation\" was forwarded to the provincial of the Order in France. After he reviewed and edited it, he published the account in a series of duodecimo volumes, known collectively as The Jesuit Relations . In France, the published texts were also shaped by the editors, who often remained anonymous. Missionary Charles Lallemont wrote a letter to his brother, dated 1 August 1626, which marks the beginning of the fathers' accounts and the series Relations des Jésuites de la Nouvelle-France about the missionary work in New France . It is believed that Louis de Buade de Frontenac , who disliked the Jesuit order, strongly influenced ending this publication. In France, the political and religious debates over the accommodation approach practised by the Jesuits in their overseas missions probably also resulted in the cessation of its publication. Criticism [ edit ] As the Jesuit order used The Jesuit Relations to help raise money for the missions, scholars have scrutinized the reports for the possibility of textual incongruity or fictionalized accounts. Certainly, the Jesuits may have worked to convey optimism about their progress in converting the Indigenous peoples, as it was very slow. There are also numerous examples of Jesuits' bias against Indigenous peoples within these texts, as well as deliberate attempts to interpret Indigenous customs through a European lens.",

While it is too soon to judge the long-term results of the latter regimens, the regimens have shown similar results when analyzed based on poor treatment responses (~10–20% poor responses). Bendamustine with rituximab may be preferable to R-CHOP or R-CVP for treating low-grade (i.e. Grades 1, 2, and possibly 3A) FL; R-CHOP may be preferred in FL that has high-risk characteristics (e.g. high levels of Beta-2 macroglobulin or bone marrow involvement). The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab has shown good potential in treating indolent cases of FL.",

It seems likely that many of the relapses in these cases are due to undetected disease outside of the radiation field at the time of radiation treatment. The use of PET/CT imaging is strongly recommended to insure that the FL is localized. In any case, the excellent results achieved with radiation therapy strongly support its use in localized disease. The use of an immunotherapeutic agent such as rituximab alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic regimen such as CVP (i.e. cyclophosphamide , vincristine , prednisone and rituximab ) in cases of localized, early-stage disease may be appropriate choices for some of these early-stage patients. However, the latter approach is recommended for cases of localized disease in which the disease extends beyond a single field: 56% of patients treated in this manner had progression-free survival at 10 years while patients treated with other regimens had progression free survivals of 41%.

At the mosque, Hanjour and al-Hazmi soon met Eyad Alrababah, a Jordanian who later pleaded guilty to document fraud and was deported. They had told him that they were looking for an apartment to rent, and he found a friend who rented them an apartment in Alexandria where they stayed. On 4 April 2001, Hanjour asked to forward his utility deposits to 3159 Row Street, Falls Church, Virginia, which was the same address as the mosque. When police raided the Hamburg apartment of Ramzi bin al-Shibh (the \"20th hijacker\") while investigating the 9/11 attacks, Awlaki's telephone number was found among bin al-Shibh's personal contact information.

          "text": "The historian David Williams , writing in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography , observes that attempts to identify his parents and antecedents \"have all proved unsatisfactory\", although his will referred to distant relations. Several sources state Morgan's father was Robert Morgan, a farmer. Nuala Zahedieh , writing for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography , states that details of Morgan's early life and career are uncertain, although in later life he stated that he had left school early and was \"much more used to the pike than the book\". It is unknown how Morgan made his way to the Caribbean. He may have travelled to the Caribbean as part of the army of Robert Venables , sent by Oliver Cromwell as part of the Caribbean expedition against the Spanish in the West Indies in 1654, or he may have served as an apprentice to a maker of cutlery for three years in exchange for the cost of his emigration. Richard Browne, who served as surgeon under Morgan in 1670 stated that Morgan had travelled either as a \"private gentleman\" soon after the 1655 capture of Jamaica by the English, or he may have been abducted in Bristol and transported to Barbados , where he was sold as a servant. In the 17th century the Caribbean offered an opportunity for young men to become rich quickly, although significant investment was needed to obtain high returns from the sugar export economy. Other opportunities for financial gain were through trade or plunder of the Spanish Empire . Much of the plunder was from privateering , whereby individuals and ships were commissioned by government to attack the country's enemies. Career as a privateer [ edit ] Sir Christopher Myngs , under whom Morgan served It is probable that in the early 1660s Morgan was active with a group of privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and settlements in the Caribbean and Central America when England was at war with Spain.",

Ali later emigrated to New Zealand, where he settled in Auckland and then in Palmerston North to train as a pilot. He was identified as a friend and colleague of Hanjour in July 2006, less than six months after he first arrived in New Zealand. Immigration Minister David Cunliffe said that Ali \"was directly associated with persons responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001\". In December, he resumed training at CRM Flight Cockpit Resource Management for a few weeks, before pursuing training at Arizona Aviation. Bandar al-Hazmi and Hanjour stayed in Arizona, continued taking flight lessons at Arizona Aviation throughout 1998 and early 1999. After moving out of Bandar's place in March, Hanjour lived in several apartments in Tempe , Mesa and Phoenix. In February, financial records showed that Hanjour had taken a trip to Las Vegas , Nevada . In addition to flight training at Arizona Aviation, Hanjour enrolled in flight simulator classes at the Sawyer School of Aviation where he made only three or four visits. Lotfi Raissi would begin taking lessons at the same school a month after Hanjour quit, part of what piqued the FBI 's interest in Raissi. An FBI informant named Aukai Collins claims he told the FBI about Hanjour's activities during 1998, giving them Hanjour's name and phone number, and warning them that more and more foreign-born Muslims seem to be taking flying lessons. The FBI admits it paid Collins to monitor the Islamic and Arab communities in Phoenix at the time, but denies Collins told them anything about Hanjour. Hanjour gained his FAA commercial pilot certificate in April 1999, getting a \"satisfactory\" rating from the examiner.",

The historic Chinatown in downtown Boise, Idaho , existed around the 1870s to 1960s. The area was located along Idaho Street, and east from 8th Street along Front Street and Grove Street. Over the years, Boise's Chinatown consisted of multiple Chinese owned residencies and businesses including restaurants, merchandise stores, laundries, two herbal medicine shops operated by three generations of the Ah-Fong family, a Chinese Masonic Hall, and a Hip Sing Tong and Hop Sing Tong . Early immigrants to Boise's Chinatown were mainly from six districts in the Guangdong Province in China (previously romanized as \"Kwangtung\" Province). It is unknown how many people of Chinese origin or descent lived in Boise's Chinatown over the years. In the U.S. 1870 Census, 78 Chinese people lived in Ada County, where Boise sits, out of a population of 2675. The Chinese population in Boise peaked in 1910 at 255 before declining. Around 1901, the city condemned wooden Chinatown buildings along Idaho Street for being fire-prone. By the 1960s, most Chinese residents moved (or were forced) out of the Boise Chinatown's core. Urban renewal is blamed for the final destruction of Boise's Chinatown. Using eminent domain, the Boise Redevelopment Agency claimed and subsequently demolished seven downtown city blocks between 1968 and 1971, this included nearly all of Boise's Chinatown. The Chinese Odd Fellows Building is one of the last surviving buildings and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places .",

This is reasonable if a person is operating a calculating device that doesn't support negative numbers since comparing the two operands before the calculation so they can be entered in the proper order, and verifying that the result is reasonable, is easy for humans to do. Use the same method to subtract 856 from 1000, and then add a negative sign to the result. Represent negative numbers as radix complements of their positive counterparts. Numbers less than b n / 2 {\\displaystyle b^{n}/2} are considered positive; the rest are considered negative (and their magnitude can be obtained by taking the radix complement). This works best for even radices since the sign can be determined by looking at the first digit. For example, numbers in ten's complement notation are positive if the first digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and negative if 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. And it works very well in binary since the first bit can be considered a sign bit : the number is positive if the sign bit is 0 and negative if it is 1. Indeed, two's complement is used in most modern computers to represent signed numbers. Complement the result if there is no carry out of the most significant digit (an indication that x was less than y ). This is easier to implement with digital circuits than comparing and swapping the operands. But since taking the radix complement requires adding 1, it is difficult to do directly.",

Mandating display [ edit ] Arkansas : In March 2017, Act 911, sponsored by state Representative Jim Dotson , made it a requirement of Arkansas state law for public schools to display posters with the national motto, if these were donated. In 2019, the law was later amended to require public display of the national motto in public schools, higher education institutions and state government buildings, if funds are available for that purpose. Florida : In early 2018, Kimberly Daniels , a Democrat state representative, introduced HB 839, a bill that requires public schools to display the motto \"In God We Trust\" in a conspicuous place. On February 21, 2018, the bill passed 97-10 in the House. Governor Rick Scott then signed the mandate into law. Idaho : House Concurrent Resolution 32, adopted in March 2020, mandates that the national motto be placed over the chairs of presiding officers of both chambers of Idaho Legislature . Kentucky : In 2014, a law was passed that obliged display of the national motto in legislative buildings and in committees. In June 2019, a bill sponsored by state representative Brandon Reed of Hodgenville was passed that required Kentucky public schools to display the motto in a prominent location, beginning from the 2019–20 school year. To protest the requirement, Fayette County Public Schools , a school district which serves Lexington , complied by posting framed one-dollar bills , which bear the slogan, while in LaRue County , of which Hodgenville is seat, schools were using oversized images of pennies . Louisiana : A bill requiring public display of the motto in public schools was introduced by state senator Regina Ashford Barrow in March 2018.",

Linguistic studies has situated the Egyptian language in the Afro-Asiatic family phylum which included the Berber , Chadic , Kushitic , Egyptian , Omotic and Semitic languages. There is no agreement on the exact origin of the proto-language but most linguists are supportive of an African origin of the proto-language spoken between 13,000 to 15,000 years whereas others support a Near Eastern origin dated to 10,000 years ago. A featured linguist, Roger Blench , in the publication had argued this remained an area of controversy due to archaeological evidence and textual sources which have suggested an origin of dispersal in the Near East. Nevertheless, he also stated that all the diversity of the Afro-Asiatic language family is concentrated in Sub Saharan Africa, especially in Ethiopia (including Omotic and Cushitic languages). Blench himself has argued that lexicon in the Chadic language is suggestive of migration westwards into waterways joining the Nile basin with Lake Chad. He further added that it was possible that early Afro-Asiatic speakers had domesticated wild cattle in the Egyptian-Sudanese border 10,000 years ago.

Manuel Buendía Tellezgirón (24 May 1926 – 30 May 1984) was a Mexican journalist and political columnist who last worked for the daily Excélsior , one of the most-read newspapers in Mexico City . His direct reporting style in his column Red Privada (\"Private Network\"), which publicly exposed government and law enforcement corruption, organized crime, and drug trafficking, was distributed and read in over 200 newspapers across Mexico. Born in the state of Michoacán , Buendía first wrote for La Nación , the official magazine of the National Action Party (PAN). After losing interest in the party, he left to work for La Prensa and became the editor-in-chief in 1960. He left the newspaper in 1963 and worked for several different media outlets in Mexico throughout the 1970s and '80s, including the Mexico City-based newspapers El Universal and Excélsior . Buendía was recognized largely for his investigative reporting, and particularly for his coverage of the CIA 's covert operations in Mexico, the rise of ultra-rightwing groups, fraudulent businessmen, corruption in Mexico's state-owned petroleum company Pemex , and the role of organized crime in Mexico's political system. He was also famous for breaking news on controversial political subjects thanks to his access to top Mexican officials. His investigative reporting, however, angered many and made him a frequent target of death threats, which he took very seriously. On the afternoon of 30 May 1984, Buendía left his office in Mexico City and was walking to his car when a man shot him from behind several times, killing him on the scene. For over five years, the murder case remained unsolved and with several irregularities, including the loss of evidence.",

After suffering another three miscarriages, Louisa gave birth in 1811 to her first daughter, and the first American born in Russia, Louisa Catherine Adams II. A year later, the infant died of dysentery , causing Louisa further grief and increasing her resentment against her husband. When John was called to Ghent in 1814 to negotiate a peace agreement for the War of 1812 , Louisa was left in Saint Petersburg, where she would remain for the next year. John learned to afford her a greater level of trust and responsibility while living in Russia, and in December 1814, he tasked her with selling their property in Russia and traveling across Europe to meet him in Paris. She left in February 1815, and for the next 40 days she made the dangerous journey across Europe, which had been ravaged by the Napoleonic Wars, in the cold winter. She was frequently in danger of bandits, and later of French soldiers hostile to her Russian carriage. John and his parents gave Louisa a greater deal of respect after she completed the journey. Return to London and Washington [ edit ] Portrait by Charles Robert Leslie , 1816 Louisa and John returned to London in 1815, as John had been appointed minister to Great Britain. Their children were sent to London as well, and the family lived there reunited for the following two years. Louisa lived more comfortably in London than she had elsewhere; the diplomatic responsibilities were lighter, and she had regular access to an Anglican church. She took on more responsibility in managing the family and assisting her husband in his work, particularly after he suffered a painful eye infection that left him temporarily blinded and an injury to his hand that left him unable to write.",

He gave me Bruce Robinson's script, which was enormous, but it was so full of passion and energy I couldn't put it down. I'd heard about Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, but didn't know much until I read it. I wrote to David saying that whoever made the film would have to be careful because it wasn't just a war story: it was about human connection, how friendships are born and what they do to us. I didn't hear from him for six months, then we bumped into one another and he said he'd interviewed most of the directors in the world – including some very big names who would make the studios happy – but no one had really understood it. \"You're the only man who has,\" he said.",

          "text": "Among these guests, the Johnson daughters looked for potential suitors, as they were pressured to marry a prominent young man. John Quincy Adams became one such guest in 1795 in his capacity as an American diplomat. He began showing up each day, and only later did the Johnsons realize that he intended to court Louisa, initially believing that his interest was in her older sister Nancy. Only after he complied with a joking request to write her a romantic poem did she consider him a potential suitor. Johnson and Adams began a courtship, though it was intermittent, and they did not immediately take to one another. Both had previously expressed interest in other potential partners. It was their talents and prestige that eventually drew them to one another. Adams in particular was taken by Johnson's aptitude for singing and music. This pairing also caused a rivalry between Louisa and her older sister, who was jealous for the man she thought would court her. Johnson and Adams were engaged by 1796, but Adams left England for work and provided a number of excuses as to why he felt they should not be wed, citing his work, his finances, and their personality conflicts. Another factor was the disapproval of his mother, Abigail Adams , who did not wish to see her son marry an Englishwoman. They communicated by letter over the following year, and Johnson came to dread their communications, as Adams's letters were humorless and chastising. Louisa and John eventually married on July 26, 1797, after pressuring from her father. Shortly after the marriage, the Johnsons lost the remainder of their fortune. Louisa's parents fled the country, leaving Louisa and John with little financial support and a mob of angry creditors. The couple disagreed about how much influence a wife should have in her family, and John often made major decisions without consulting her. Both had strong personalities, and their disagreements often became arguments.",

The Cup final appearance raised hopes that the club could win a trophy the following season but a change to the offside rule during the off-season, reducing the number of players required between an attacker and the net, proved difficult to adapt to for Cardiff's defence and they finished in 16th place. The disappointing start to the season led Fred Stewart to revamp the playing squad, including selling long-serving forward Jimmy Gill to Blackpool for £3,200 in the opening months of the campaign.

          "text": "The work won warm admiration not only for the ideas it contained, but for its literary style. It made Winckelmann famous, and was reprinted several times and soon translated into French. In England, Winckelmann's views stirred discussion in the 1760s and 1770s, although it was limited to artistic circles: Henry Fuseli 's English translation, entitled Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks , was published in 1765, and reprinted with corrections in 1767. Rome [ edit ] In 1751, the papal nuncio in Saxony, Alberico Archinto , visited Nöthnitz and was highly impressed by Winckelmann. In 1754 Winckelmann converted to the Roman Catholic Church. Goethe concluded that Winckelmann was a pagan, while Gerhard Gietmann contended that Winckelmann \"died a devout and sincere Catholic\"; either way, his conversion ultimately opened the doors of the papal library to him. On the strength of the Gedanken über die Nachahmung der Griechischen Werke , Augustus III , king of Poland and elector of Saxony, granted him a pension of 200 thalers , so that he could continue his studies in Rome. Winckelmann arrived in Rome in November 1755. His first task there was to describe the statues in the Cortile del Belvedere —the Apollo Belvedere , the Laocoön , the so-called Antinous , and the Belvedere Torso —which represented to him the \"utmost perfection of ancient sculpture\". Originally, Winckelmann planned to stay in Italy only two years with the help of the grant from Dresden, but the outbreak of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) changed his plans.",

          "text": "Jorge Luis Borges in 1951 At the turn of the 20th century, modernismo emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío 's Azul (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. José Martí , for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere. However, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as Julio Cortázar 's Rayuela (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was Gabriel García Márquez 's Cien años de soledad (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with magic realism , though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was Augusto Roa Bastos 's monumental Yo, el supremo (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as Juan Rulfo , Alejo Carpentier , and above all Jorge Luis Borges were also rediscovered. Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Diamela Eltit , Giannina Braschi , Ricardo Piglia , or Roberto Bolaño . There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimonio , texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as Rigoberta Menchú .",

This in turn lead to a coup attempt by the dynasty and their sympathizers. Prior to the conquest, it was also Hirabu who successfully defeated Sultan Abu Bakr , permitting the Imam to initiate the conquest. Umar Din along with Wazir Nur and Garad Akmoscia had initiated a plan with the aim of killing the Imam and making Umar Din ruler. Qadi Abu Bakr hearing this, travelled to Zerba where the Imam stayed and told him everything, the Imam responded, he was ready to cede the country to them, however Emir Hussein Al Gaturi and numerous others were strongly opposed to this, and told him to higher a huge army composed of the Somalis to end their plans. In the meantime, the cousin of the Imam , Hirabu had already killed the son of Umar Din who had joined his father in the plot attempts and he sent a letter to the Imam asking for help, begging and exclaiming how Hirabu would kill him as well if he was not stopped. The Imam wanting to maintain law and order within the kingdom accepted his repeated apologies, and let his cousin go to the capital of the Marehan country in Kidad, pretending to hide to ensure there was lawfullness and order in the country, he later fled to hide in Hawiye country.

Upon completion, it will be the largest shipyard in the world. Development of the facility began in November 2015, when Saudi Arabian oil and gas company Saudi Aramco and South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) regarding development of marine industry in Saudi Arabia, including a large shipyard. In January 2016, it was announced that the partnership to construct the shipyard had expanded with the signing of an MoU between the National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia , Maritime Offshore Limited (a Lamprell subsidiary), Saudi Aramco, and HHI. The consortium subsequently signed a joint development agreement in June to undertake feasibility analysis of the shipyard, which had by then been confirmed to be sited in Ras Al-Khair. Royal HaskoningDHV and Hyundai Engineering & Construction were awarded a design contract for the facility in October 2016, and the ceremonial groundbreaking took place on 29 November 2016, although the first major construction contract, for dredging on site preparation, was not signed until May 2017. In November 2017, Saudi Aramco awarded China Power Construction Group a $3 billion contract to build the shipyard facilities. Total construction costs are estimated to be about US$4.3 billion. The complex is scheduled to open in stages from late 2018 through 2022, when it will reach full capacity. When complete, the facility is estimated to increase the gross domestic product of Saudi Arabia by $17 billion, while decreasing the country's imports by $12 billion and supporting 80,000 jobs nationally.",

          "text": "When complete, the facility is estimated to increase the gross domestic product of Saudi Arabia by $17 billion, while decreasing the country's imports by $12 billion and supporting 80,000 jobs nationally. The facility will be about 4.96 square kilometres (1,230 acres) in area, with several dry docks and at least 15 separate piers. It will have four major areas of operation—shipbuilding, ship repair, oil rig construction, and oil rig support. In July 2017, Hyundai Heavy Industries signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop with Saudi Aramco and investment company Dussur a $400 million factory to build medium speed marine diesel engines at the complex. In January 2018, the anchor facility at the complex, a shipyard named International Maritime Industries, was incorporated with orders for at least 20 oil rigs and 50 ships.

However, this create a divide in the ability to develop technological skills among the Korean citizens. Those who live in Seoul all their lives are able to pick up new technological skills and keep themselves updated with all the technological changes. On the contrary, for those who live in other urban cities, even though they rely on the Internet heavily, they do not pick up new technological skills as quickly as those who live in Seoul since their cities do not mass implement the systems Seoul heavily relies on. This is the same for those who live on the country side, except that Internet access is much more difficult to get compared to living in any city. Therefore, those who live on the country side tend to not pick up new technological skills quickly nor keep themselves updated with new technological devices being pushed out.

There is another lake, Staro jezero (\"Old Lake\"), in the town itself. It is a remnant of the former river Galacka, part of the Mureș river system. The river was diverted at a time, partially channeled and conducted underground, so there is no river in Kikinda today. In the city, there is a park called Blandaš, which was declared a natural monument. The tree line along the 2 km (1.2 mi) long Generala Drapšina Street is made up of 400 trees, and the street was declared the 22nd most beautiful street in the world by the Architecture and Design magazine. The tree line was planted after the World War II, even before the war ended in the rest of Europe and Yugoslavia. It is believed that the seedlings were a gift from the U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt , due to his friendship with Mihajlo Pupin . In the vicinity of Kikinda is the Copper Age kurgan of Kinđa , which possibly gave name to the city.

The initial focus of MAP centred on predicting the endemicity of Plasmodium falciparum , the most deadly form of the malaria parasite, due to its global epidemiological significance and its better prospects for elimination and control. Work in 2009 began to map the extent and burden of the relatively neglected Plasmodium vivax . The Repository for Open Access Data from the Malaria Atlas Project (ROAD-MAP) was established in 2011. The project moved from the University of Oxford in the UK to the Telethon Kids Institute in Perth, Western Australia, in September 2019. In late 2023, an East African branch of MAP was established at the Ifakara Health Institute in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Academic research [ edit ] Modelling malaria prevalence [ edit ] A key aspect of MAP's work is to use statistical approaches to modelling the prevalence of different forms of malaria on a global scale using Bayesian model-based geostatistics . Plasmodium falciparum prevalence maps [ edit ] In September 2015, research by MAP published in Nature quantified the attributable effect of malaria disease control efforts in Africa. The results showed Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in endemic Africa halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40% between 2000 and 2015. The best estimate is that interventions have averted 663 million clinical cases since 2000. Insecticide-treated nets, the most widespread intervention, were by far the largest contributor. Although still below target levels, current malaria interventions have substantially reduced malaria disease incidence across the continent. Plasmodium vivax prevalence maps [ edit ] In 2012, MAP published the first global maps for Plasmodium vivax endemicity.",

          "text": "In commonwealth countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia where a coroners inquest is usually held, experts are often called in, evidence is gathered and is made publicly available. The chain of events starts with one or more triggering events which leads to the disabling agent (harmful event) , which causes the disabling injury, which leads to the cause of death, which in most cases is drowning, but a finding of drowning is, on its own, not usually useful to improve safety, simply because so many possible chains of events underwater lead to drowning. Learning from accidents [ edit ] The general recreational diving community's capacity for learning from accidents is limited by several factors, though this is not a universal trend: Uncertainty of risk [ edit ] Risk in diving is seldom known with any accuracy. The large amount of uncertainty regarding the probability of most forms of failure make it necessary for the diver or diving supervisor to estimate risk based on experience and what little data is available, often not much more than personal experience. Decisions based on these estimates tend to be affected by bias and circumstances. A dive that has required a major outlay in time and monetary cost, or which affects reputation, if cancelled, represents a definite loss, which when balanced against a possible loss of unknown probability, may induce the team to take a greater risk than if the perceived loss due to cancellation were less, even when the likely consequences of the low probability consequences are relatively dire. There is a tendency for losses to have a bigger subjective value than gains, which pushes people to risk more to avoid a definite loss. Various cognitive biases may influence decisions whether or not to cancel a dive on site: Plan continuation bias and the sunk cost fallacy Availability bias Hindsight bias Overconfidence Dunning–Kruger effect . When one doesn't know what one doesn't know, incompetent decisions may be made without being aware of it.",

The decision by Judge Azcarate to allow livestreaming, a rarity in Virginia courts, has been criticized.

Social media coverage [ edit ] Data collected by Newswhip from April 4 to May 16, 2022, indicated that news articles about the trial had generated more social-media interactions per article in the United States than all other significant news topics, including the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on abortion , Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter , the inflation surge , and the Russian invasion of Ukraine . Twitter , TikTok , and Instagram users expressed opinions about the case or rallied against others doing the same. Clips of the trial were used to create memes, compilation or reaction videos, with multiple such videos going viral . Those posting about the trial on social media were seen to mostly support Depp and oppose Heard.",

Khalepsky, Head of the Department of Mechanisation and Motorisation of the RKKA, wrote a letter to S. Ginzburg with information obtained via the intelligence service that the Polish government had decided to purchase Vickers 6-Ton light infantry tanks as well as Christie M1931 cavalry tanks and to mass-produce them with the assistance of both the British and French. Because Poland was then considered, in Soviet military doctrine, to be the USSR's main enemy, the Soviet Revolutionary Military Council decided to pass the foreign tanks into Red Army service, starting their production immediately without waiting for the completion of development works, in order to counter possible aggression. At that time, the RKKA had only several dozen outdated Mark V heavy tanks and Medium Mk.A and Renault FT tanks, captured during the Russian Civil War , together with various armoured cars and obsolescent domestic MS-1 (T-18) light infantry tanks. On 13 February 1931, the Vickers 6-Ton light infantry tank, under the designator T-26, officially entered service in the Red Army as the \"main tank for close support of combined arms units and tank units of High Command Reserve\". One of the Vickers 6-Ton tanks (equipped with Soviet-made turrets for the pilot batch of T-26 tanks) was tested for gunfire resistance in August 1931. The hull was subjected to rifle and Maxim machine gun fire with the use of normal and armour-piercing bullets at a range of 50 m (160 ft). It was found that the armour withstood gunfire with minimal damage (only some rivets were damaged).",

Even so, the British armour was better than armour produced by Izhora Factory for the first T-26s because of a shortage of modern metallurgical equipment in the USSR at that time. At the same time, the Faculty of Mechanisation and Motorisation of the Military Technical Academy named after F.E. Dzerzhinsky developed two tank models (TMM-1 and TMM-2) based on the Vickers 6-Ton tank design but with an American Hercules 95 hp (71 kW) six-cylinder water-cooled engine, improved front armour (to 15–20 mm), and a driver's position on the left side. TMM stands for tank maloy moshchnosti or \"tank of low power\". The TMM-1 was equipped with transmission details from the native Ya-5 truck [ ru ] and a ball mount for the DT tank machine gun in front of the hull, whereas the TMM-2 was equipped with an improved gearbox, a clutchless steering device and a 37 mm Hotchkiss gun in the right turret. Representatives from the main Soviet tank manufacturers together with officials from the RKKA Mobilization Department considered the Hercules engine to be too difficult to produce, and the engine tended to overheat inside the engine compartment. Tests of TMM-1 and TMM-2 prototypes performed in the beginning of 1932 demonstrated no advantage over the Vickers 6-Ton and the T-26 (the TMM-2's maneuverability was found to be even worse).

In addition to the RAAF's contribution, several of the RAN's cruisers and destroyers escorted shipping in the Atlantic and Caribbean and hundreds of RAN personnel served aboard Royal Navy ships in the Atlantic throughout the war. Air war over Europe [ edit ] The RAAF's role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia's main contribution to the defeat of Germany. Approximately 13,000 Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF Bomber Command between 1940 and the end of the war. There was not a distinctive Australian contribution to this campaign, however, as most Australians served in British squadrons and the Australian bomber squadrons were part of RAF units. Members of No. 460 Squadron and the Lancaster bomber G for George in August 1943 The great majority of Australian aircrew in Bomber Command were graduates of the Empire Air Training Scheme. These men were not concentrated in Australian units, and were instead often posted to the Commonwealth squadron with the greatest need for personnel where they became part of a multi-national bomber crew. Five Australian heavy bomber squadrons ( No. 460 , No. 462 , No. 463 , No. 466 and No. 467 squadrons) were formed within Bomber Command between 1941 and 1945, however, and the proportion of Australians in these units increased over time. No. 464 Squadron , which was equipped with light bombers, was also formed as part of Bomber Command but was transferred to the Second Tactical Air Force in June 1943, where it continued to attack targets in Europe. Unlike Canada, which concentrated its heavy bomber squadrons into No. 6 Group RCAF in 1943, the RAAF squadrons in Bomber Command were always part of British units, and the Australian Government had little control over how they were used.

In the beginning, the building served as the city curia and the seat of the District of Velika Kikinda until its abolishment in 1876. In 1946, the National Museum of Kikinda and the City Archive were founded and housed in the building. The Museum boasts numerous artifacts which are displayed in its four sections: archeological, historical, ethnological and naturalist. As of recently, it also possesses a mammoth skeleton which was excavated on the grounds of the \"Toza Marković\" brick factory in 1996. The Jovan Popović National Library was founded in 1845 as Čitaonica Srbska (Serbian Reading Room). It was renamed in 1952 to Jovan Popović in honor of a prominent poet from Kikinda. Besides serving its primary function of loaning books, the library also organizes literary meetings, book promotions, seminars, lectures, exhibitions, and has published several works. Although the National Theater in Kikinda was founded only 50 years ago, Kikinda has a long theatrical tradition. Kikinda witnessed its first theatrical play in 1796 in German. The first play in Serbian was performed in 1834. The theater has a continuous program all year round, including the summer when the stage is set up outside, in the yard of the theater. The most famous band is Downstroy formed in 2004. In 2007, the group was the first in the history of the ex-YU to perform at one of the biggest heavy metal festivals in the world - Wacken Open Air .",

He also supported Turkish nationalism against its Ottoman counterpart, along with secularism ( anti-clericalism or laicism) against theocracy . Frashëri was one of the sons of an impoverished bey from Frashër (Fraşer during Ottoman rule) in the District of Përmet . He gained a place in Ottoman literature as a talented author under the name of Şemseddin Sami Efendi and contributed to the Ottoman Turkish language reforms. Frashëri's message, however as declared in his book \"Albania - What it was, what it is, and what will become of it\" published in 1899, became the manifesto of the Albanian National Awakening. He discussed the prospects for a united, free and independent republic of Albania. In this way, beginning with a demand for autonomy and struggle for their own alphabet and education, Frashëri helped the Albanian National Movement develop its claim for independence. His lifetime goal, as that of many other members of the Albanian renaissance was the development and improvement of Albania's culture and eventual establishment of an independent country. Life [ edit ] Museum house of the Frashëri Brothers in Frashër, Përmet, Albania Sami Frashëri was born in 1850 in the village of Frashër in the Vilayet of Janina , Ottoman Empire (modern Albania ) to a distinguished Muslim Albanian family of Bektashi religious affiliations.",

The city's urban area has 32,084 inhabitants, while the city administrative area has 49,326 inhabitants. The city was founded in the 18th century. From 1774 to 1874 Kikinda was the seat of the District of Velika Kikinda , an autonomous administrative unit of Habsburg monarchy . In 1893, Kikinda was granted the status of a city. The city became part of the Kingdom of Serbia (and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes ) in 1918, and it lost the city status. The status was re-granted in 2016. In 1996, the well-preserved archaeological remnants of a half a million-year-old mammoth were excavated on the outer edge of the town area. The mammoth called \"Kika\" has become one of the symbols of the town. Today it is exhibited in the National Museum of Kikinda. Other attractions of the city are the Suvača – a unique horse-powered dry mill , the annual Pumpkin Days and the International Symposium of Sculpture \"Terra\". The winter roosts of long-eared owls , with a large number of individuals, are easily accessible as they are situated in town parks and attract birdwatchers both from this country and abroad.",

When asked why by the surprised Basehart, who had never before played the part of a clown, Fellini responded: \"Because, if you did what you did in Fourteen Hours you can do anything.\" A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony. Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by I Vitelloni , and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: \"It was his zest for living, and his humor.\" Filming [ edit ] The film was shot in Bagnoregio , Viterbo , Lazio , and Ovindoli , L'Aquila , Abruzzo . On Sundays, Fellini and Basehart drove around the countryside, scouting locations and looking for places to eat, sometimes trying as many as six restaurants and venturing as far away as Rimini before Fellini found the desired ambiance and menu. Production started in October 1953, but had to be halted within weeks when Masina dislocated her ankle during the convent scene with Quinn. With shooting suspended, De Laurentiis saw an opportunity to replace Masina, whom he had never wanted for the part and who had not yet been signed to a contract. This changed as soon as executives at Paramount viewed the rushes of the scene and lauded Masina's performance, resulting in De Laurentiis announcing that he had her on an exclusive and ordering her to sign a hastily prepared contract, at approximately a third of Quinn's salary. The delay caused the entire production schedule to be revised, and cinematographer Carlo Carlini, who had a prior commitment, had to be replaced by Otello Martelli , a long-time favorite of Fellini's.",

The corps consisted of the 3rd Division, 11th Brigade and Fiji Infantry Regiment on Bougainville and the 23rd Brigade which garrisoned neighbouring islands and was supported by RAAF, RNZAF and USMC air units. While the XIV Corps had maintained a defensive posture, the Australians conducted offensive operations aimed at destroying the Japanese force on Bougainville. As the Japanese were split into several enclaves the II Corps fought geographically separated campaigns in the north, centre and southern portions of the island. The main focus was against the Japanese base at Buin in the south, and the offensives in the north and centre of the island were largely suspended from May 1945. While Australian operations on Bougainville continued until the end of the war, large Japanese forces remained at Buin and in the north of the island. The 6th Division was assigned responsibility for completing the destruction of the Japanese Eighteenth Army , which was the last large Japanese force remaining in the Australian portion of New Guinea. The division was reinforced by CMF and armoured units and began arriving at Aitape in October 1944. The 6th Division was also supported by several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships. In late 1944, the Australians launched a two-pronged offensive to the east towards Wewak . The 17th Brigade advanced through the inland Torricelli Mountains while the remainder of the division moved along the coast. Although the Eighteenth Army had suffered heavy casualties from previous fighting and disease, it mounted a strong resistance and inflicted significant casualties. The 6th Division's advance was also hampered by supply difficulties and bad weather.",

He also co-starred with Neve Campbell in Robert Altman 's ballet movie The Company (2003). The success of the first Spider-Man film led Franco to reprise the role in the 2004 sequel, Spider-Man 2 . The movie was well received by critics, and it proved to be a big financial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With a revenue of $783 million worldwide, it became the second highest-grossing film in 2004.

The original maximum penalty mandated for convicted citizens may have been banishment to an island and confiscation of property, but by the later empire the imposition of capital punishment in its various forms, with distinction between honestiores and humiliores , had become standard. The law further not only punished the poisoner but also equally, if distinct, the suppliers and manufacturers of the potion which had induced the death. The concern of the provisions against suppliers of abortifacients seems to be safeguarding the life of the mother, for whose murder or endangerment the supplier would be charged, not the foetus . The penalties of the Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis were imposed by Hadrian on castrators, already generally banned by Domitian , and by edict of Antoninus Pius on all who performed circumcision on males, with special exemption for the Jews .

It was still in force in the time of Justinian in the 6th century A.D. The provisions of the law were described by the later Roman jurist Paul as including: Suppliers of love potions or abortifacients to be relegated to the mines if lower class ( humiliores ), banished to an island if upper class ( honestiores ), or executed if the potion results in death. Those who perform bewitching or binding spells to be crucified or thrown to the beasts. Those who engage in human sacrifice or make offerings of human blood in temples to be thrown to the beasts if lower class, executed if upper class. Practitioners of magic to be thrown to the beasts or crucified. A professional \" magus \" to be burned alive. Possessors of magical books ( libri artis magicae ) to have their property confiscated and the books publicly burned, if upper class then exiled, if lower class executed. Suppliers of drugs given as cures that result in death to be executed if lower class, banished to an island if upper class. The law significantly moved to replace the traditional Roman penalty of the Poena cullei for poisoners and practitioners of malign magic, which involved being sewn up in a sack and thrown into the river, with more standard punishments.",

Authors since the start of the 21st century include Alfian Sa'at and Rachel Heng . Singaporean literature in Malay can be traced back to 1841. One of the earlier known works of Singaporean literature in Malay was written by Abdullah Bin Abdul Kadir, a Malay scribe, with his work Cherita Kapal Asap . Some of the other earlier known Malay writers include Tuan Simi and Masuri S. N. Singaporean Malay literary works were similar to its Malaysian counterpart before the early 1970s. Many early pioneers of Singaporean literature in Malay relocated to Malaysia before Singapore became independent as they wanted to be part of the larger Malay community in Malaysia due to the common language in writing. By the 1970s, due to the difference in governance between Singapore and Malaysia, literary works in Malay between the two countries became more distinguishable, with Singapore literature in Malay revolving around the themes of freedom, authenticity and criticality.

Their first published book, 1890's The Bondman , was a huge success in the United Kingdom and launched the company. He was joined in 1893 by Sydney Pawling . Heinemann died in 1920 and Pawling sold the company to Doubleday , having worked with them in the past to publish their works in the United States. Pawling died in 1922 and new management took over. Doubleday sold his interest in 1933. Through the 1920s, the company was well known for publishing works by famous authors that had previously been published as serials . Among these were works by H. G. Wells , Rudyard Kipling , W. Somerset Maugham , George Moore , Max Beerbohm and Henry James , among others. This attracted new authors to publish their first editions with the company, including Graham Greene , Edward Upward , J. B. Priestley and Vita Sackville-West . Throughout, the company was also known for its classics and international catalogue, and in the post-WWII era, the company focused on educational materials. Through the 1950s, the company was slowly taken over by Tilling Group 's investment arm. In 1953 they opened offices in The Hague for sales in continental Europe, and in 1978 they opened a separate company in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to sell their educational works in the US market. When Tilling was purchased by BTR plc in 1983, BTR sold off all their non-industrial assets; Heinemann was sold to Octopus Publishing Group . Octopus merged with Reed International (later Reed Elsevier) in 1987, who then sold their entire trade-oriented publishing assets to Random House in 1997.",

          "text": "Between 1895 and 1897, Heinemann was the publisher of William Ernest Henley 's periodical New Review . In the late 1890s, Heinemann and the American publisher Frank Doubleday financially supported Joseph Conrad during his initial attempt at writing what eventually became The Rescue , and Heinemann was the British publisher for Conrad's The Nigger of the 'Narcissus' in 1897. One of the company's businesses at that time was to sell English books to a Japan that was beginning to be interested in items of Western culture. Heinemann sold to the Japanese bookstore Maruzen translations of the works of Dostoyevsky and 5000 copies of Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution by Peter Kropotkin. In 1912, the company began publishing the Loeb Classical Library series, publications of ancient works with the Greek or Latin text on the left-hand page, and a literal translation on the right hand page. The series has been called \"the most significant\" of the parallel-text translations. Since 1934, it has been co-published with Harvard University . On Heinemann's death in 1920 a majority stake was purchased by U.S. publisher Doubleday , with Theodore Byard , who had previously been a professional singer, joining to lead the offices. A subsidiary company was established in The Hague in 1953; originally intended to distribute works in English to continental Europe, it eventually began to directly print Heinemann's books as well. The company was later acquired by conglomerate Thomas Tilling in 1961. When the impending takeover became known, Graham Greene (who had been with Heinemann since his first work in 1929) led a number of Heinemann authors who protested by taking their works to other publishers, including The Bodley Head , of which Greene was a director. Heinemann Publishing was established in the United States in 1978 as a U.S.",

In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the U.S. in 1850. In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch , an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century. Obama has described the ancestors of his grandparents as Scotch-Irish mostly. Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo . His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa , where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii , on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born. In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle , where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University , where he earned a Master of Arts in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964. Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the Ministry of Finance. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.",

          "text": "All Out is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event held by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) since 2019. It was originally held during Labor Day weekend and is one of AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, which also includes Double or Nothing , Full Gear , and Revolution , their four biggest domestic shows produced quarterly. On April 11, 2024, AEW announced that the sixth All Out event would take place on Sunday, September 1, 2024, at the Now Arena in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois . However, on May 21, 2024, AEW announced that All Out would instead take place a week later on Saturday, September 7, 2024, marking the first All Out to not be held during Labor Day weekend. This change came in response to fan concerns of the event being held only one week after All In , which had occurred the prior year. This subsequently returned the event to Saturday for the first time since 2020 as well as to the Now Arena, being the fourth overall at the venue, after 2019 , 2021 , and 2022 . Due to the event being held on Saturday, Collision and Rampage were held live back-to-back on Friday, September 6 in the Chicago area. Storylines [ edit ] All Out featured professional wrestling matches that were the result of pre-existing feuds and storylines , with results being predetermined by AEW's writers. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite , Collision , and Rampage . On the July 10 episode of Dynamite , Pac defeated Claudio Castagnoli , Kyle Fletcher , and Tomohiro Ishii in a Global Glory Four-Way match to earn an AEW International Championship match at All Out.",

          "text": "Softball rules vary in certain aspects from those of baseball. The game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball due to the field being smaller and the bases and the fielders being closer to home plate. Softball is pitched underhand from flat ground, whereas baseball is pitched overhand from a raised pitcher's mound . History [ edit ] Early history [ edit ] First photo of a softball team, Chicago, 1897 The earliest known softball game was played in Chicago , Illinois, on Thanksgiving Day, 1887. It took place at the Farragut Boat Club at a gathering to hear the outcome of the Yale University and Harvard University football game. When the score was announced and bets were settled, a Yale alumnus threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard fan grabbed a stick and swung at the rolled-up glove. George Hancock , a reporter there, called out \"Play ball!\" and the game began, with the boxing glove tightened into a ball, a broom handle serving as a bat. This first contest ended with a score of 41–40. The ball, being soft, was fielded barehanded. Hancock is credited as the game's inventor for his development of a 17-inch ball and an undersized bat in the next week. The Farragut Club soon set rules for the game, which spread quickly to outsiders. Envisioned as a way for baseball players to maintain their skills during the winter, the sport was called \"Indoor Baseball\". Under the name of \"Indoor-Outdoor,\" the game moved outside in the next year, and the first rules were published in 1889. Indoor baseball player, 1907 In 1895, Lewis Rober Sr. of Minneapolis organized outdoor games as exercise for firefighters ; this game was originally known as kitten ball.",

          "text": "Another common theory is that the km hieroglyph depicts a piece of charcoal. Most scholars hold that kmt means \"the black land\" or \"the black place\", and that this is a reference to the fertile black soil that was washed down from Central Africa by the annual Nile inundation . By contrast the barren desert outside the narrow confines of the Nile watercourse was called dšrt (conventionally pronounced deshret ) or \"the red land\". Raymond Faulkner's Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian translates kmt into \"Egyptians\", Gardiner translates it as \"the Black Land, Egypt\". ' At the UNESCO Symposium in 1974, French Egyptologist Serge Sauneron stated that in Egyptian km meant 'black', the masculine plural was Kmu (Kemou) and the feminine plural Kmnt and that the form Kmtyw could mean 'those of Kmt', 'the inhabitants of Kmt' ('the black country'). It was a derived adjective (nisba) derived from a geographical term which had become a proper name; it was not necessarily 'felt' in its original meaning (cf. Frank, France, French). To indicate 'black people', the Egyptians would have said Kmt or Kmu, not Kmtyw, they never used this adjective to designate the black people of the African hinterland whom they knew about from the time of the New Kingdom onwards and, in general, nor did they use names of colours to categorize people. In the 11th-12th dynasty Ancient Egypt came to be called by the Egyptians Kemet ( 'km.t' ) (kemet) a derivative of km and also Ta-meri (“The Beloved Land”) (tꜣ-mrj). km.t is a feminine derivative of km in the ancient Egyptian language.",

          "text": "General Qi also wrote a military book named Jixiao Xinshu which depicted, among other things, the detailed usage of the wodao . He also included a wodao branch in his army alongside branches of other weapons. Another Ming general Li Chengxun (李承勋), in his own revised edition of Jixiao Xinshu of 1588, quoted General Qi as saying that the long sword (believed to be referring to the ōdachi and tachi ) was introduced into China during the wokou invasion of the Ming dynasty. The Chinese martial art of wielding the wodao is believed to be a combination of medieval Japanese sword fighting styles and traditional Chinese techniques regarding the use of two-handed weapons. The term wodao was still in usage in China until the Qing dynasty as evidenced in various Chinese novels at the time. In 1921, the Chinese warlord Cao Kun created a branch in his army that specialized in wielding two-handed single edged blades and called it the miaodao branch. Since then, miaodao became the name for this form of Chinese two-handed single edged blade and the term wodao is now rarely used. The art of wielding the miaodao can be traced back to the lineage of Jixiao Xinshu . A long Wodao sword currently in existence in a Chinese museum. The 21st-century Miaodao sword used in Chinese martial arts, developed from the long wodao sword of the Ming dynasty . Qiu Jin 's wodao at Datong Academy in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, China. This is a one-handed sabre-like style sword that has been reformed. See also [ edit ] Katana References [ edit ] ^ Wang, Guangxi (9 March 2012). Chinese Kung Fu . Cambridge University Press. p. 86.

The car produced 65 hp (48 kW) at 4,600 rpm and had a top speed of 86 mph (138 km/h), compared to the 34 hp (25 kW) and 72 mph (116 km/h) top speed of the Type 14 Karmann Ghia. 18,119 TC models were sold during their production that began at the turn of 1970 until the end of their sales in 1976. It was offered only in South America and was not exported off the continent. There is a prototype that is part of the factory museum collection of Karmann in Osnabrück , Germany. Subsequent concepts [ edit ] In 1990, Karmann introduced a Karmann Ghia-inspired concept car – the Karmann Coupe – at the Frankfurt Motor Show , and in April 2013 Karmann Ghia do Brasil launched a competition for Brazilian students to design a modern interpretation of the classic Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia Coupé, possibly leading to the development of a prototype.

          "text": "DVD covers of Victory by Design documentaries Victory by Design is a series of documentary films produced in the 1990s and 2000s on the subject of famous racing automobile marques . The series began as a single film focused on Porsche , directed by award-winning film-maker Tony Maylam , executive produced by Clive Pullan and hosted by former racing driver Alain de Cadenet . Further episodes - beginning with an episode on Ferrari were commissioned by American cable channel Speedvision who brought in Martin Stockham to produce the new programs. More specials, focused on Maserati , Jaguar , Alfa Romeo , Aston Martin , Lotus , Corvette , \"Ford Muscle\" (primarily covering the Ford-powered Shelby Cobra , Shelby -built high-performance Mustangs , and the GT40 ), and \" Grand Prix Greats\" were ordered by Speedvision's successor, the Fox owned cable channel, Speed Channel . The \"Grand Prix Greats\" episode is notable in that instead of a single manufacturer, it covers various notable Grand Prix cars from 1908 to 1960, including Renault , Lancia , and the Cooper Car Company . The series has been consistently popular on the channel and also in the DVD market. Each program features exceptional racing and street cars from the marque. Generally, the cars are presented in chronological order of their production dates. For each car, de Cadenet describes the historical background and impetus for its design. Important mechanical aspects of the car are also pinpointed and described by de Cadenet. The cars are then filmed as de Cadenet enters the cockpit, straps himself in, starts the engine, and test drives them. As de Cadenet describes in a \"making of\" documentary, each car is presented in a setting that suits the nature of the car, and they are driven in the way they were meant to be driven.",

          "text": "Paula Todd , a lawyer and media professor, raised the question of how many of the jury members would listen to the judge's instructions to avoid accessing online coverage. Law professor Mary Anne Franks said, \"[I]t's crazy to think they are not going to be influenced by what's happening on social media,\" further noting that she encountered out-of-context, distorted depictions of the trial despite trying to avoid reading about the case. Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond School of Law professor, said \"I don't envy the judge—or the jurors—because it's hard to protect them from [outside] influences,\" noting that such outside influences inhibit the justice system's ability to \"give people a fair day in court.\" Following the trial, a juror denied that the jury had been influenced by social media, saying, \"We followed the evidence. We didn't take into account anything outside [...] They were very serious accusations and a lot of money involved. So we weren't taking it lightly.\" Comments by juror [ edit ] Following the trial, a juror was interviewed by Good Morning America . The juror stated that he found that Depp and Heard \"were both abusive to each other\" but that Heard's team failed to prove that Depp's abuse was physical. \"They had their husband-wife arguments. They were both yelling at each other, I don't think that makes either of them right or wrong [...] But to rise to the level of what she was claiming, there wasn't enough or any evidence that really supported what she was saying\". The juror opined that Heard's testimony was not \"believable\" because it \"seemed like she was able to flip the switch on her emotions\", while Depp \"seemed a little more real in terms of how he responded to questions\".",

Urban Renewal [ edit ] Empty lot in Ybor City The period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s saw two seemingly contradictory trends in Ybor City history. While the neighborhood was dying, two of its native sons, Nick Nuccio and Dick Greco , became the first \"Latins\" to serve as mayor of Tampa . Despite this newfound political clout, Ybor City stagnated and declined. As its cigar industry continued to consolidate, mechanize, and cut workforce, its population steadily moved to other parts of Tampa (especially West Tampa ) or out of the Tampa area altogether. The Federal Urban Renewal Program of the 1960s were supposed to revitalize Ybor City with new residences and businesses designed to attract tourists to \"Tampa's Latin Quarter\" (a nod to the French Quarter in New Orleans ). Thousands of remaining residents were forced to move as entire blocks of old homes, business, and cigar factories were razed. Due to a lack of funds and political will, however, the replacement construction never took place, and old buildings were replaced by empty lots. Another blow was the construction of Interstate 4 , which cut east–west across the approximate center of the neighborhood. Besides resulting in the demolition of even more homes and other structures, the highway cut most of the north–south routes through the area. Cuban embargo [ edit ] Ybor City's cigar industry had been in decline for years by the early 1960s, but the most serious blow of all came in February 1962, when rising tensions between Fidel Castro 's Cuban government and the United States led to an embargo on all imports from Cuba , including tobacco.",

The Latin name denarius banalis was derived from the words ban (\"viceroy\") and denarius . The coins were first minted in Pakrac , and from 1260 in Zagreb . They were well made, of quality silver, because of which became common exchange currency in Central Europe. There exist some 400 types and sub-types of banovac. Banovac included on obverse the image of a marten ( Croatian : kuna ) between two six-pointed stars (inspired by moving leopard / lion from frizatiks and duke's CoA ), because marten pelts were highly valued goods used as a form of payment in Slavonia ( marturina ). This was one of the reasons for naming the former currency of the Republic of Croatia the kuna (used 1994–2023).

For decimal currencies that would be 10, 100, 1,000, etc., e.g. a $10.00 bill. In grade school education [ edit ] In grade schools, students are sometimes taught the method of complements as a shortcut useful in mental arithmetic . Subtraction is done by adding the ten's complement of the subtrahend , which is the nines' complement plus 1. The result of this addition is used when it is clear that the difference will be positive, otherwise the ten's complement of the addition's result is used with it marked as negative. The same technique works for subtracting on an adding machine.

In the picture on the cover the chest is seen as though it were viewed from above the patient's head. The dark spaces to the left and right are the lungs. The large red area in the middle is the heart. The white areas are bone; below the center is the spinal column, and around the lungs are sections through the ribs. In general the tomato red areas are muscular tissue and the lavender areas are fatty tissue. The branched areas in the lungs are blood vessels and bronchi. The picture was made (by the Delta Scanner built by Ohio-Nuclear, Inc.) in the course of a study that was conducted by Ralph J. Alfidi, M.D. of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.\" In CT, Technicare developed and sold the DeltaScan line of products. A prototype whole body scanner was installed in 1974 at the Cleveland Clinic . The body scanner was installed there and was introduced first. This was followed with the head only dual slice Delta 25 which competed with the EMI Mark-I, the world's first CT scanner. This followed the body scanner, Delta 50 one of the first devices to scan the whole body. Both the Delta 25 and 50 scanned the patient in 1–2 minutes which was about twice as fast as EMI products.",

Waldorf Lunch, Harvard Square, 1918 Interior, Harvard Square, 1913 tile The Harvard Square location opened in 1913 and closed in 1938, when it became a Hayes-Bickford cafeteria. In 2017, when the space was being renovated to become a branch of the local Clover Food Lab chain, the original Waldorf decor, with college pennants in tile, was exposed. Besides operating retail restaurants, the Waldorf System built and operated company lunchrooms. In 1919, the Waldorf company went public. By then, it had 38 stores and had acquired Kinney & Woodward (14 stores) and Baldwin's (7), also founded in Springfield from 1904-1909. In 1919, Waldorf acquired the assets of the Automat Company, a local automat restaurant , and in 1924 converted the Little Building location to cafeteria format. It also acquired the Clark Restaurant Company (1922, restaurants in Ohio), the Ginter Restaurant Company (1927, Boston table service restaurants), St. Clairs', Inc. (1929, Massachusetts table service restaurants), and the Fort Hill Supply Company (1927, restaurant equipment). In 1921, Samuel Bickford, a Waldorf vice-president, left to start his own lunchroom business in New York, Bickford's Lunch . Bickford's later merged with Hayes lunch, and Hayes-Bickford restaurants were often near Waldorf restaurants, and competed.",

Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , the Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term. In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the 2008 financial crisis , it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 , which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States , and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights. In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act , which brought an end to \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGBT people; the law went into effect the following year. In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.",

          "text": "Contributors to that album included guitarist Masami Tsuchiya , bassist Mark Egan , percussionist David Van Tieghem , drummer Steve Jordan , Sting , Herbie Hancock and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd . Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well as contributing percussion to the Power Station album. According to Rhodes, the two side projects \"were commercial suicide... But we've always been good at that.\" The band regrouped to contribute \" A View to a Kill \" to the 1985 James Bond film of the same name . This single was the first Bond theme to go to number one on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number two. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years. As a follow-up to the Christmas 1984 Band Aid single, Duran Duran performed in front of 90,000 people (and an estimated 1.5 billion TV viewers) at the Live Aid charity concert at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania, on 13 July 1985 while their Bond song held the top spot on the American charts. It was not intended to be a farewell performance—the band planned only to take a break after four years of non-stop touring and public appearances—but the original five did not play live together again until July 2003. During their Live Aid set, Le Bon inadvertently hit an off-key falsetto note in the chorus of \"A View to a Kill\", an error that was trumpeted by numerous media outlets as \"The Bum Note Heard Round the World\" (in contrast to Freddie Mercury 's \"Note Heard Round the World\" at the Wembley Stadium Live Aid show). Le Bon later described the moment as the most embarrassing of his career.",

While the Applewhites are regarded as the first major black characters on the series, Cherry stated that the role of Betty was originally offered to two white film actresses, both of whom turned it down due to financial and time commitment issues. He clarified: \"There's nothing strategically black about her character. Her color is incidental.\" Woodard stated that she had never seen the show before accepting the role, something that led the producers to send her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members. After they compared storylines, Woodard recalled that she became \"instantly hooked\" on the series. Woodard reported experiencing heavy media attention after accepting the role. Both Brooks and his brother, Billy, auditioned for the role of Matthew. The final decision came down to both brothers as well as two other actors. According to Cherry, Brooks was cast because he exuded a \"dangerous\" element, as well as \"a combination of this wholesome, sweet quality and a dark, brooding quality.\" Cast [ edit ] Main articles: List of Desperate Housewives cast members and List of Desperate Housewives characters Regular [ edit ] Supporting [ edit ] Woodard 's character was the subject of the season's main mystery. The second season had fourteen roles receiving star billing, out of whom eleven were part of the first season 's main cast.

In 1839, Champollion's and Volney's claims were disputed by Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac , who blamed a misunderstanding of the ancients for spreading a false impression of a \" Negro \" Egypt, stating \"the two physical traits of black skin and woolly hair are not enough to stamp a race as negro\" and \"the opinion that the ancient population of Egypt belonged to the Negro African race, is an error long accepted as the truth. ... Volney's conclusion as to the Negro origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization is evidently forced and inadmissible.\" Gaston Maspero , a 19th-century French Egyptologist, stated that \"by the almost unanimous testimony of ancient Greek historians, they ( Ancient Egyptians ) belonged to the African race, which settled in Ethiopia .\" Heinrich Karl Brusch , a 19th-century German Egyptologist stated that \"according to ethnology, the Egyptians appear to form a third branch of the Caucasian race... and this much may be regarded as certain\". E.A. Wallis Budge , a 19th-century British Egyptologist, argued that \"There are many things in the manners and customs and religions of the historic Egyptians that suggest that the original home of their ancestors was in a country in the neighbourhood of Uganda and Land of Punt \". The debate over the race of the ancient Egyptians intensified during the 19th century movement to abolish slavery in the United States , as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical, mental and physical inferiority of black people.",

          "text": "One attempts to identify who was involved in a deviation from the recommended procedure, and the other attempts to identify why deviation from the recommended procedure seemed to be a good idea at the time. The first approach tends to apportion blame, on the assumption that the recommended procedure was, in fact, optimum, and the other aims to learn why the recommended procedure was not considered appropriate at the time. This second approach has been shown to be more productive of learning from the experience, but can only work within a just culture in which the people involved feel safe to discuss the details. Categories of error [ edit ] Reason categorizes how errors occur by analysing what causes a plan to fail. If a plan is good, but poorly executed, then failure is due to slips, lapses, trips or fumbles . If the plan itself is faulty, then failure is due to a mistake . If established or approved procedures or regulations are intentionally ignored, then a mistake can be categorised as a violation . Levels of performance [ edit ] These error categories relate to three levels of human performance: Skill-based: Routine, practiced tasks performed in a largely automatic fashion, with occasional conscious progress checks. Rule-based: If the automatic responses are unsuitable, a switch of level can be made where memorized performance patterns or rules are applied. These are structured on an If (situation), then do (actions) pattern, often similar to one from previous experience, and perceptions of the current situation are used to select an appropriate solution from memory. Potential solutions are developed through education, training, and experience, and are selected automatically from memory, but verified that they are appropriate by conscious thought. Knowledge-based: When solutions from memory do not suit the current situation, the fall back is to knowledge-based solutions, where the current situation must be analysed and a solution developed in real time. Performance is relatively slow and laborious and the process is subject to errors resulting from constraints of information, time, understanding, intelligence and distractions.",

According to a New York Times article from October 18, 2021, the Asian population of Long Island City has grown fivefold since 2010 nearing 11,000 residents making up 34% of the neighborhood's population. The new Asian residents are mainly Chinese, Bengalis, Koreans, and Japanese, and the neighborhood had at least 15 Asian-owned businesses in the neighborhood. Unlike the largely working-class Asian immigrant populations in southern Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, the growing Asian population in Long Island City tends to be second- or third-generation Americans and are largely middle or upper class. Exceptionally however, the growing Asian population in NYCHA 's Queensbridge Houses section of Long Island City at 11% are mostly from immigrant working-class backgrounds and largely have limited English skills, which has presented issues when residents are unable to find interpreters to communicate with NYCHA. New York City Council member Julie Won , who represents the neighborhood, has spoken about the need for outreach to the area's Asian residents and businesses.

His subsequent influence on Gotthold Ephraim Lessing , Johann Gottfried Herder , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Friedrich Hölderlin , Heinrich Heine , Friedrich Nietzsche , Stefan George and Oswald Spengler has been provocatively called \"the Tyranny of Greece over Germany\". Winckelmann was homosexual , and open homoeroticism informed his writings on aesthetics. In 1752, he mentioned the \"lust\" which could be experienced with the \"divine monarch\" (i.e. Frederick the Great ) in Potsdam in a similar way as in \"Athens and Sparta\", and which he could enjoy so immensely that he would never again be allowed to. His homosexuality was recognized by his contemporaries, such as Goethe. In 1768, at the age of 50, he was murdered by a fellow guest at his hotel for reasons that remain unclear. Biography [ edit ] Early life [ edit ] Winckelmann was born in poverty in Stendal in the Margraviate of Brandenburg . His father, Martin Winckelmann, worked as a cobbler, while his mother, Anna Maria Meyer, was the daughter of a weaver. Winckelmann's early years were full of hardship, but his academic interests pushed him forward. Later in Rome, when he had become a famous scholar, he wrote: \"One gets spoiled here; but God owed me this; in my youth I suffered too much.\" Winckelmann attended the Köllnisches Gymnasium in Berlin and the Altstädtisches Gymnasium at Salzwedel , and in 1738, at the age of 21, went as a student of theology to the University of Halle .",

He was a pioneering Hellenist who first articulated the differences between Greek , Greco-Roman and Roman art . \"The prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology \", Winckelmann was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the history of art . Many consider him the father of the discipline of art history . He was one of the first to separate Greek art into periods and time classifications. He had a decisive influence on the rise of the Neoclassical movement during the late 18th century. His writings influenced not only a new science of archaeology and art history but Western painting, sculpture, literature and even philosophy. Winckelmann's History of Ancient Art (1764) was one of the first books written in German to become a classic of European literature.",

          "text": "They were now set to face Holyrood Hippogriffs, a team from Scotland which they had no experience playing with at its current roster, so the match-up seemed as though it could go either way. Oxford started strong, using their back-driver strategy well, though there was a moment mid-way through the game where Holyrood used a time-out and it looked as though the momentum had swung entirely in their favour, as they scored a small number in a row with seemingly minimal opposition from Oxford to put the game at even footing. However, OUQC managed to bring the game back under their control, and eventually won the final with a score 130* -50. This put them at 3 all-time BQC wins, and they were the first quadball team to reach that mark. This was followed by the Werewolves of London later in the tournament, on the Community League side of the tournament, though OUQC are still the most decorated University League team to date.

Walsh (central; gold number 21) during the away leg of the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea in 2023 Although she faced pressure while adapting to the specialised number 6 role at Barcelona, Walsh \"felt much better after the Christmas break\"; fellow holding midfielder Patri Guijarro felt they played fluidly together from Christmas onwards and that Walsh had adapted \"in record time\". Increasingly comfortable within the squad, she reached her peak form again. A key part of the team from the start of the 2022–23 season , Walsh won her first title with them in January 2023 with the 2022–23 Supercopa de España : she helped Barcelona to victory playing in both the semi-final and, despite having gone off during extra-time in the semi-final with an injury, the final three days later on 22 January. In subsequent games, she was rested with the injury; shortly after her return she scored her first goal for Barcelona, on 5 February against Real Betis , with a shot from outside the box. Walsh was differential for Barcelona in the away leg victory of their Champions League semi-final tie against Chelsea, playing what Sport said was her best game for the club yet, in which \"she showed that version of pivot that characterises the azulgrana style.\" Walsh reached the final of the Champions League for the first time after Barcelona defeated Chelsea 2–1 on aggregate. Three days later, on 30 April, the team won the league at home with four matches to play and an all-wins record.",

Compute the nines' complement of 218, which is 781. Because 218 is three digits long, this is the same as subtracting 218 from 999. 2. Next, the sum of x {\\displaystyle x} and the nines' complement of y {\\displaystyle y} is taken. 873 [x] + 781 [nines' complement of y = 999 - y] ————— 1654 [999 + x - y] 3.

Then 1000 was subtracted when the leading 1 was dropped. So, the answer obtained (654) is one less than the correct answer x − y {\\displaystyle x-y} . To fix this, 1 is added to the answer. 654 + 1 ————— 655 [x - y] Adding a 1 gives 655, the correct answer to our original subtraction problem. The last step of adding 1 could be skipped if instead the ten's complement of y was used in the first step.",

          "text": "In displaying that data in the complement window (red set), the operator could see the nines' complement of the nines' complement of the minuend, that is the minuend. The slat was then moved to expose the black digits (which now displayed the nines' complement of the minuend) and the subtrahend was added by dialing it in. Finally, the operator had to move the slat again to read the correct answer. The Comptometer had nines' complement digits printed in smaller type along with the normal digits on each key. To subtract, the operator was expected to mentally subtract 1 from the subtrahend and enter the result using the smaller digits. Since subtracting 1 before complementing is equivalent to adding 1 afterwards, the operator would thus effectively add the ten's complement of the subtrahend. The operator also needed to hold down the \"subtraction cutoff tab\" corresponding to the leftmost digit of the answer. This tab prevented the carry from being propagated past it, the Comptometer's method of dropping the initial 1 from the result. The Curta calculator used the method of complements for subtraction, and managed to hide this from the user. Numbers were entered using digit input slides along the side of the device. The number on each slide was added to a result counter by a gearing mechanism which engaged cams on a rotating \"echelon drum\" (a.k.a. \"step drum\"). The drum was turned by use of a crank on the top of the instrument. The number of cams encountered by each digit as the crank turned was determined by the value of that digit. For example, if a slide is set to its \"6\" position, a row of 6 cams would be encountered around the drum corresponding to that position. For subtraction, the drum was shifted slightly before it was turned, which moved a different row of cams into position.",

          "text": "The expected answer is −144, which isn't as far off as it seems; 856 happens to be the ten's complement of 144. This issue can be addressed in a number of ways: Ignore the issue. This is reasonable if a person is operating a calculating device that doesn't support negative numbers since comparing the two operands before the calculation so they can be entered in the proper order, and verifying that the result is reasonable, is easy for humans to do. Use the same method to subtract 856 from 1000, and then add a negative sign to the result. Represent negative numbers as radix complements of their positive counterparts. Numbers less than b n / 2 {\\displaystyle b^{n}/2} are considered positive; the rest are considered negative (and their magnitude can be obtained by taking the radix complement). This works best for even radices since the sign can be determined by looking at the first digit. For example, numbers in ten's complement notation are positive if the first digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and negative if 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. And it works very well in binary since the first bit can be considered a sign bit : the number is positive if the sign bit is 0 and negative if it is 1. Indeed, two's complement is used in most modern computers to represent signed numbers. Complement the result if there is no carry out of the most significant digit (an indication that x was less than y ). This is easier to implement with digital circuits than comparing and swapping the operands. But since taking the radix complement requires adding 1, it is difficult to do directly.",

          "text": "Duran Duran parted ways with Capitol/EMI in 1999, although the label has since used Duran Duran's back catalogue to release several compilations of remixes and rare vinyl-only B-sides. The band then signed what was intended to be a three-album contract with Disney Music Group 's Hollywood Records , but it lasted only through the poorly received 2000 album Pop Trash . This slow-paced and heavy album seemed out-of-keeping with earlier band material. Rhodes' intricate production and Cuccurullo's songwriting and experimentation with guitar sounds and time signatures were not enough to hook the public, and the album did not perform well. The dreamy single \" Someone Else Not Me \" lasted barely two weeks on the radio, although its video was noted as the first to be produced entirely with Flash animation. While supporting Medazzaland and Pop Trash , Duran Duran toured with bassist Wes Wehmiller and drummer Joe Travers. 2001–2005: Reunion [ edit ] Duran Duran performing live at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto , Canada, 2005 In 2000, Le Bon approached John Taylor with a proposal to reform Duran Duran's classic line-up. They agreed to part company with Cuccurullo after completing the Pop Trash tour. Cuccurullo then announced on his website that he was leaving Duran Duran to resume work with his 1980s band Missing Persons . This announcement was confirmed the next day by Duran Duran's website, followed a day later by the news that John, Roger and Andy had rejoined. To fulfill contractual obligations, Cuccurullo played three Duran Duran concerts in Japan in June 2001, ending his tenure in the band.",

The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. At 08:54, Flight 77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south, and then hijackers set the flight's autopilot heading for Washington, D.C. Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, United States Solicitor General Ted Olson , and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. Using the flight intercom, Hanjour announced the flight was hijacked. As Flight 77 was 5 miles (8.0 km) west-southwest of the Pentagon, it made a 330-degree turn. At the end of the turn, it was descending through 2,200 feet (670 m), pointed toward the Pentagon and downtown Washington. Hanjour advanced the throttles to maximum power and dove towards the Pentagon at a speed of over 530 mph (850 km/h). At 09:37:46, Hanjour crashed the Boeing 757 into the west façade of the Pentagon , killing himself and all 63 passengers and 6 crew members aboard along with 125 on the ground in the Pentagon. While level above the ground and seconds from the crash, the airplane's wings knocked over light poles and its right engine smashed into a power generator, creating a smoke trail seconds before smashing into the Pentagon. In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight 77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any DNA samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI.",

          "text": "Higher deflection angles allow a CRT of a given size to be slimmer, however they also impose more stress on the CRT envelope, specially on the panel, the seal between the panel and funnel and on the funnel. The funnel needs to be long enough to minimize stress, as a longer funnel can be better shaped to have lower stress. Comparison with other technologies [ edit ] Main article: Comparison of CRT, LCD, plasma, and OLED displays One of the defining points of comparison LCD advantages over CRT: Lower bulk, power consumption and heat generation, higher refresh rates (up to 360 Hz) CRT advantages over LCD: Better color reproduction, no motion blur, multisyncing available in many monitors, no input lag OLED advantages over CRT: Lower bulk, similar color reproduction, higher contrast ratios, similar refresh rates (over 60 Hz, up to 120 Hz) except for computer monitors. On CRTs, refresh rates depend on resolution, both of which are ultimately limited by the maximum horizontal scanning frequency of the CRT. Motion blur also depends on the decay time of the phosphors. Phosphors that decay too slowly for a given refresh rate may cause smearing or motion blur on the image. In practice, CRTs are limited to a refresh rate of 160 Hz. LCDs that can compete with OLED (Dual Layer, and mini-LED LCDs) are not available in high refresh rates, although quantum dot LCDs (QLEDs) are available in high refresh rates (up to 144 Hz) and are competitive in color reproduction with OLEDs. CRT monitors can still outperform LCD and OLED monitors in input lag, as there is no signal processing between the CRT and the display connector of the monitor, since CRT monitors often use VGA which provides an analog signal that can be fed to a CRT directly. Video cards designed for use with CRTs may have a RAMDAC to generate the analog signals needed by the CRT.",

Queues at bus stops serving the affected stations were as long as 100 metres (330 ft). Many commuters were also confused with the transport arrangements, such as the location of free bridging bus stops for closed stations. Some voiced their frustration regarding the disruption and its spillover effects, including the longer travel time and the long walking distance between Jurong East station and its free bridging bus stop. It is estimated that the disruption affected more than 2.1 million commuters as of 30 September, with 358,000 passengers on the first day, 516,000 passengers on the second day, and 500,000 passengers on the third day of the disruption. According to minister Chee, commuters travelling between Boon Lay and Queenstown were not charged, with bridging and regular bus services provided for free. The incident occurred during the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). In response to the disruption, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced that students taking the PSLE on 26 September were granted the full allocated time to sit their paper as long as they turned up before the end of the exam. Free taxi services were offered to ferry students to their examination venues from affected stations, though according to The Straits Times , the taxis were not used by the students. According to MOE, five students were late for their papers on 26 September due to the disruption. One student took the examination in another examination centre, and all of them were given the full duration of the paper. Additionally, according to the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB), no candidates were affected by the disruption for the Mathematics exam on 27 September. On 30 September, the SEAB reported that seven students were late for their papers on that day.",

It was originally held during Labor Day weekend and is one of AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, which also includes Double or Nothing , Full Gear , and Revolution , their four biggest domestic shows produced quarterly. On April 11, 2024, AEW announced that the sixth All Out event would take place on Sunday, September 1, 2024, at the Now Arena in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois . However, on May 21, 2024, AEW announced that All Out would instead take place a week later on Saturday, September 7, 2024, marking the first All Out to not be held during Labor Day weekend. This change came in response to fan concerns of the event being held only one week after All In , which had occurred the prior year. This subsequently returned the event to Saturday for the first time since 2020 as well as to the Now Arena, being the fourth overall at the venue, after 2019 , 2021 , and 2022 . Due to the event being held on Saturday, Collision and Rampage were held live back-to-back on Friday, September 6 in the Chicago area. Storylines [ edit ] All Out featured professional wrestling matches that were the result of pre-existing feuds and storylines , with results being predetermined by AEW's writers. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite , Collision , and Rampage . On the July 10 episode of Dynamite , Pac defeated Claudio Castagnoli , Kyle Fletcher , and Tomohiro Ishii in a Global Glory Four-Way match to earn an AEW International Championship match at All Out.",

          "text": "1918 Nova in the constellation Monoceros The location of GI Monocerotis (circled in red) GI Monocerotis , also known as Nova Monocerotis 1918 , was a nova that erupted in the constellation Monoceros during 1918. It was discovered by Max Wolf on a photographic plate taken at the Heidelberg Observatory on 4 February 1918. At the time of its discovery, it had a photographic magnitude of 8.5, and had already passed its peak brightness. A search of plates taken at the Harvard College Observatory showed that it had a photographic magnitude of 5.4 on 1 January 1918, so it would have been visible to the naked eye around that time. By March 1918 it had dropped to ninth or tenth magnitude. By November 1920 it was a little fainter than 15th magnitude. The light curve of the GI Monocerotis. The blue points are photographic magnitudes measured at the Harvard College Observatory . If multiple measurements with identical times were reported, they were averaged before plotting The red points are visual magnitudes from the AAVSO . A single pre-eruption photographic detection of GI Monocerotis exists, showing its magnitude was 15.1 before the nova event. GI Monoceros dropped by 3 magnitudes from its peak in about 23 days, making it a \"fast nova\". Long after the nova eruption, six small outbursts with a mean amplitude of 0.9 magnitudes were detected when the star was monitored from the year 1991 through 2000. Radio emission from the nova has been detected at the JVLA in the C (5 GHz), X (8 GHz) and K (23 GHz) bands. All novae are binary stars, with a \"donor\" star orbiting a white dwarf .",

          "text": "In Play Novel Silent Hill , they choose from options that appear as the story progresses to advance the story, such as like how to engage a monster or which way to follow Cheryl. The story changes depending on the choices the player makes. Some choices greatly affect the path of the story while others cause very minor changes. Interspersed between these text options is the occasional mini-game, such as sliding tile styled games. After completing the story from the perspective of Harry Mason, the player can select Cybil Bennett's scenario during a new play session. Using the Mobile Adapter GB , players can play an additional scenario called \"Boy's Story\", where the player can view the story from the point of view of a boy named Andy. Plot [ edit ] Harry's scenario follows the events of the first Silent Hill game the closest and is narrated from his perspective. Harry arrives in Silent Hill, a North Eastern town in the United States; he wakes up in his car to a cold breeze and finds that his daughter that should be in the passenger seat next to him is missing. On seeking her out he walks into a shadowy alley and appears to be attacked by unknown forces. He wakes up in a café, where he meets Cybil Bennett, a police officer who offers him a gun for self-defense. After she leaves, Harry hears a strange sound, on investigating a monster breaks through a window, he eventually fires at it leaving it to fall to the ground, confirming that these creatures he's seeing are real. Harry continues to explore, finding a note he presumes is left by Cheryl that guides him to a school. Various choices from this point change the ending of the story, leading to endings that leave characters such as Cybil dead. 28 endings were created between the Cybil and Harry scenarios. These endings cover a host of different situations that could unfold if key moments in the original game not occurred as they had.",

The high king, Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid (died 862) of Clann Cholmáin had reduced Munster to complete submission in 858 and detached Osraige from Munster in 859. The King of Munster, Máel Gualae mac Donngaile (died 859), was then captured by the Norse and stoned to death. In 860, the men of Munster accompanied the forces of the high king in his expedition to the north against the Northern Ui Neill. The Norse Vikings in Munster remained active in this period. In 866, Vikings from Limerick led by Tomrar plundered Clonfert but were then defeated and Tomrar went mad and died on the Isle of Man. The Ciarraige tribe then attacked his followers and with the aid of the sea they were victorious. Also, in 866, The Norse of Cork, led by a man named Gním Cinnsiolaigh, led an attack on the Fir Maige Fén, a tribe centered at (Fermoy, County Cork). The Déisi , however, joined forces with the attacked and defeated the Norse leader who fled to a fort for refuge. The Norse leader appealed to Cenn Fáelad for protection but he refused it and the Norse leader was dragged from his refuge and killed. In 871, an attack on Munster by the powerful Osraige king Cerball mac Dunlainge is recorded as far as West Munster across the Sliabh Luachra. The death of Cenn Fáelad is recorded in 872 after prolonged suffering.",

In Mbatu, near Bamenda, three people were killed by armed separatists. On 8 September, a former separatist fighter was killed in an alleged targeted attack in Bamenda. In Sop, Bui, three separatist fighters were killed in a confrontation with the Cameroonian army. On 16 September, two separatist fighters were killed during an operation by the Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR) in Worsing, Bali Nyonga. In a separate incident, another separatist fighter was killed in a BIR attack between Sabga, Kedjon Ketinguh and Bamessing. A civilian was also killed in the clashes. On 19 September, a suspected separatist IED detonated and numerous gunshots erupted in Bamenda. On 24 September, AGovC leader Ayaba Cho Lucas was arrested in Norway and charged with inciting crimes against humanity. AGovC vice president Julius Nyih took over as interim leader of the organization, in accordance with a contingency succession plan. On 1 October, separatists across the Anglophone regions celebrated Ambazonia's independence day with parades and meetings. In many of the major cities, the streets were deserted due to separatist-imposed ghost towns. Separatists held large parades in rural areas. A group known as the Ambazonia State Army, led by \"General Talk and Do\", held a military parade in Kikaikom.",

The objectives included attempting to determine familial relationships among 11 royal mummies of the New Kingdom, as well to research for pathological features including potential inherited disorders and infectious diseases. In 2022, S.O.Y. Keita analysed 8 Short Tandem loci (STR) data published as part of these studies by Hawass et al., using an algorithm that only has three choices: Eurasians, sub-Saharan Africans, and East Asians. Using these three options, Keita concluded that the majority of the samples, which included the genetic remains of Tutankhamun, showed a population \"affinity with \" sub-Saharan \" Africans in one affinity analysis\". However, Keita cautioned that this does not mean that the royal mummies \"lacked other affiliations\" which he argued had been obscured in typological thinking. Keita further added that different \"data and algorithms might give different results\" which reflects the complexity of biological heritage and the associated interpretation. According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft, conflicting DNA analysis conducted by different research teams on ancient Egyptians such as the Amarna royal mummies, which included the remains of Tutankhamun, has led to a lack of consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins. In 2025, biochemist Jean-Philippe Gourdine reviewed genetic data on the Ancient Egyptian populations in the international scholarly publication, General History of Africa Volume IX.",

As of the early 1990s, Cosby's promotional agency was the William Morris Agency . At the Advertising Hall of Fame induction ceremonies on March 30, 2011, Cosby was the first winner of the American Advertising Federation 's President's Award for Contributions to Advertising, for special achievements in the field. Criticism [ edit ] In 1973, The Village Voice writer Terry Guerin said Cosby was past his prime. Among the reasons, \"making spokesman commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He has evolved into a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader Sammy Davis has always been\". \"The Noble Cos,\" a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for The Nation , was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, \"So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars ... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke does do business in South Africa ... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?' My buddy didn't understand my commercials improve race relations. Y'see, by showing that a black man can be just as money-hungry as a white man ... I'm proving that all men are brothers.\" In 1981, Cosby told Black Enterprise magazine: In this business, many of us are well paid but we are not all that wealthy. You may read 'X-number of dollar goes to so and so,' but remember, everybody takes a cut – the lawyer, the agent, the publicist.",

          "text": "Despite the new Chinese cultural wave generated by the Higashiyama culture , some polychrome portraiture remained – primary in the form of chinso paintings of Zen monks. Catching a Catfish with a Gourd (located at Taizō-in , Myōshin-ji , Kyoto), by the priest-painter Josetsu , marks a turning point in Muromachi painting. In the foreground a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. It is generally assumed that the \"new style\" of the painting, executed about 1413, refers to a more Chinese sense of deep space within the picture plane. By the end of the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (山水画 sansuiga ) had found patronage by the ruling Ashikaga family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. A further development of landscape painting was the poem picture scroll, known as shigajiku . The foremost artists of the Muromachi period are the priest-painters Shūbun and Sesshū . Shūbun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of Shōkoku-ji , created in the painting Reading in a Bamboo Grove (1446) a realistic landscape with deep recession into space. Sesshū, unlike most artists of the period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. Landscape of the Four Seasons ( Sansui Chokan ; c. 1486) is one of Sesshu's most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.",

As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the long history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and the adaptation of imported ideas, mainly from Chinese painting , which was especially influential at a number of points; significant Western influence only comes from the 19th century onwards, beginning at the same time as Japanese art was influencing that of the West . Areas of subject matter where Chinese influence has been repeatedly significant include Buddhist religious painting, ink-wash painting of landscapes in the Chinese literati painting tradition, calligraphy of sinograms , and the painting of animals and plants, especially birds and flowers . However, distinctively Japanese traditions have developed in all these fields. The subject matter that is widely regarded as most characteristic of Japanese painting, and later printmaking , is the depiction of scenes from everyday life and narrative scenes that are often crowded with figures and detail. This tradition no doubt began in the early medieval period under Chinese influence that is now beyond tracing except in the most general terms, but from the period of the earliest surviving works had developed into a specifically Japanese tradition that lasted until the modern period. The official List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings) includes 162 works or sets of works from the 8th to the 19th century that represent peaks of achievement, or very rare survivals from early periods. Timeline [ edit ] Ancient Japan and Asuka period (until 710) [ edit ] The origins of painting in Japan date well back into Japan's prehistoric period .",

          "text": "Timeline [ edit ] Ancient Japan and Asuka period (until 710) [ edit ] The origins of painting in Japan date well back into Japan's prehistoric period . Simple figural representations, as well as botanical, architectural, and geometric designs are found on Jōmon period pottery and Yayoi period (1000 BC – 300 AD) dōtaku bronze bells. Mural paintings with both geometric and figural designs have been found in numerous tumuli dating to the Kofun period and Asuka period (300–700 AD). Along with the introduction of the Chinese writing system ( kanji ), Chinese modes of governmental administration, and Buddhism in the Asuka period, many art works were imported into Japan from China and local copies in similar styles began to be produced. Nara period (710–794) [ edit ] Mural painting from the Takamatsuzuka Tomb . National Treasure . With further establishment of Buddhism in 6th- and 7th-century Japan, religious painting flourished and was used to adorn numerous temples erected by the aristocracy. However, Nara-period Japan is recognized more for important contributions in the art of sculpture than painting. The earliest surviving paintings from this period include the murals on the interior walls of the Kondō ( 金堂 ) at the temple Hōryū-ji in Ikaruga, Nara Prefecture . These mural paintings, as well as painted images on the important Tamamushi Shrine include narratives such as jataka , episodes from the life of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni , in addition to iconic images of buddhas, bodhisattvas , and various minor deities. The style is reminiscent of Chinese painting from the Sui dynasty or the late Sixteen Kingdoms period. However, by the mid-Nara period, paintings in the style of the Tang dynasty became very popular.",

          "text": "The Book of Gates is a funerary text appears in a number of New Kingdom tombs, and they were usually provided for the guidance of the soul of the deceased. The Egyptians did not assign a name to this text; it was later termed 'Livre des Portes' (Book of Gates) by the French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero . This particular scene (4th division, 5th hour) was also not titled by the Egyptians. It depicts Egyptians and three other ethnic groups being led to the afterlife by Horus. Some, in modern times call it the \"Table of Nations\" a phrase sometimes used by biblical scholars referring to the unrelated genealogical record in Genesis 10. Others in modern times, such as E.A. Wallis Budge 9in 1906), have called the scene \"The Four Races of Men\" Budge's interpretation of the Egyptian text describing each figure: \"The first are RETH, the second are AAMU, the third are NEHESU, and the fourth are THEMEHU. The RETH are Egyptians , the AAMU are dwellers in the deserts to the east and north-east of Egypt, the NEHESU are the black races, and the THEMEHU are the fair-skinned Libyans .\" The archaeologist Karl Richard Lepsius documented many ancient Egyptian tomb paintings in his work Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien. In 1913, after the death of Lepsius, an updated reprint of the work was produced, edited by Kurt Sethe . This printing included an additional section, called the \"Ergänzungsband\" in German, which incorporated many illustrations that did not appear in Lepsius' original work.",

Aside from these mentioned, UNTV also acts as a news channel. In case of developing stories, and even important or scheduled live coverage, UNTV pre-empts its regularly scheduled programming to give way for the developing news stories and/or important coverage of a news story as it happens. Regular scheduled programming resume once the coverage of an important event has ended. Television stations [ edit ] Digital stations [ edit ] UNTV is currently testing Japan's Integrated Service Digital Broadcasting - Terrestrial (ISDB-T), the sole digital television (DTV) standard in the Philippines for its transition from analog to digital broadcast. On October 2, 2014, UNTV began its simulcast test broadcast on UHF Channel 38 (617.143 MHz) with three high definition (HD) channel and one 1seg channel. UNTV's digital broadcast can be received in Metro Manila and nearby provinces using ISDB-T set top boxes, including LED TV sets and mobile devices with built-in ISDB-T tuners. In a DTV signal test conducted by Philippine mobile phone brand Starmobile last April 2015, UNTV was present in eight out of 14 locations in Metro Manila with decent signal strength of three up to the maximum of four signal bars. Digital channel line-up [ edit ] Satellite broadcast [ edit ] UNTV can be received via satellite in the Philippines and other countries in Asia, Australia, Middle East, Europe and Africa. Pay television [ edit ] Internet streaming [ edit ] UNTV can be received via online streaming by encoding the network's streaming link URL in the VLC Media Player installed on personal computers and mobile devices.

          "text": "This method is called quadrature scanning, as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape formats. The tape ran at a speed of either 7.5 or 15 in (190.5 or 381.0 mm) per second; the audio, control, and cue tracks were recorded in a standard linear fashion near the edges of the tape. The cue track was used either as a second audio track, or for recording cue tones or time code for linear video editing . The quadruplex format employs segmented recording; each transversely recorded video track on a 2-inch quad videotape holds one-sixteenth (NTSC) or one-twentieth (PAL) of a field of interlaced video. (For NTSC systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field.) This meant that 2-inch quad did not support \"trick-play\" functions, such as still, shuttle, and reverse or variable-speed playback. In fact, the quadruplex format could only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape was playing at normal speed. However, it was capable of producing extremely high-quality images with a horizontal resolution of about 400 lines per picture height , and remained the de facto industry standard for television broadcasting from its inception in 1956 to the mid-1980s, when newer, smaller, and lower-maintenance videotape formats such as Type C videotape superseded it. There were three different variations of 2-inch quad: Low-band, which was the first variety of quad introduced by Ampex in 1956, High-band, which used a wider bandwidth for recording video to the tape, resulting in higher-resolution video from the video tape recorder (VTR), and Super high-band, which used a pilot tone for better timebase stability, and higher coercivity tape.",

          "text": "The killing was immediately condemned by the administration of President Miguel de la Madrid , who promised to bring the perpetrators to justice through a thorough investigation. However, the investigation dragged for over five years with no arrests and several inconsistencies, including the loss of evidence. On 11 June 1989, Zorrilla Pérez himself was charged with planning the murder; Juan Rafael Moro Ávila, also a DFS agent and great-grandnephew of former President Manuel Ávila Camacho , was charged of being a co-perpetrator with José Luis Ochoa Alonso (alias El Chocorrol ), who shot Buendía at point-blank. Another hypothesis was that Moro was only responsible for driving the motorcycle used by the real assassin, Juan Arévalo Gardoqui, then Secretariat of National Defense , to escape. Three other DFS agents were also arrested: Juventino Prado Hurtado, Raúl Pérez Carmona and Sofía Naya. At least two main suspects, José Luis Ochoa Alonso and Juan Arévalo Gardoqui, were reported murdered in unclear circumstances before being formally charged. The perpetrators were apprehended in 1989 under the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving at least half of their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he failed to provide a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla was released from prison after a Mexico City judge granted him the opportunity to fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions.",

Her works found their way into various anthologies whose editors – some of them distinguished critics – were quite willing to call them poems, even if their author was not. In 1894, she brought out two other books: The Land of Pluck , a collection of sketches and stories which takes its name from the opening article about Holland, and When Life is Young , which opens with her well-known poem \"The Minuet\", and contains many other favorite pieces. Both books won praise from critics, and a very large audience among young readers. During her career as an editor, Dodge published seven books for adults as well as two books for small children, Baby Days and Bay World . \"The Two Mysteries\", \"Enfoldings\", and \"The Compact \" demonstrated her depth and tenderness of feeling, intellectual poise, spiritual insight, and simplicity of expression. Personal life [ edit ] \"Yarrow\" cottage Dodge lived in a large apartment-building overlooking Central Park in New York City. In 1888, she purchased a cottage, which she named \"Yarrow\", in the summer colony at Onteora Park, Onteora Park , Tannersville, New York , upon the slope of Onteora Mountain, in the Catskill Mountains . In the beginning, it was a simple little square frame-house, and Dodge took great delight in adding, year by year, a room or a veranda, a bay-window or an extension, until she created, at last, a many-gabled home, to which she returned each season. One of her sons died in 1881, and the other, James Mapes Dodge , was a successful inventor and manufacturer, residing in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .",

          "text": "The Rocket Science and Boffo collaboration was first revealed in 1995, as one of two games made with the BAGEL engine; the other was with Time Warner. According to Dornbrook, the budgeting scheme to develop the engine was split across \"at least\" two games, a gamble that Boffo felt was viable because of its number of simultaneous projects. The Time Warner contract collapsed in the fall of 1995, alongside the publisher itself, and the Time contract was lost after roughly four months of production. Microsoft, planned as what Dornbrook called a \"fallback\", became unavailable after the start of its partnership with DreamWorks Interactive in March 1995. This had given DreamWorks exclusive rights to develop games in the interactive movie and adventure game genres; Microsoft agreed not to compete in these fields. With The Space Bar as Boffo's sole project, its engine was left underfunded. As a result, Boffo was forced to pitch new titles to other publishers to raise money, a process that continued throughout its development. Like the games with Time and Time Warner, however, none of these further projects were ultimately released. During early 1996, a rumor about Rocket Science's impending closure spread within the game industry. Company co-founder Peter Barrett exited the publisher, which then underwent corporate restructuring in February: new hires included Bill Davis of Sierra On-Line , who became the vice president of product development. That same month, Rocket Science partnered with CyberCash in a venture to develop microtransaction -based arcade games for the Internet. According to Dornbrook, outside infusions of capital allowed Rocket Science to remain in business. The publisher signed Boffo for several more titles, and a deal was reached to increase The Space Bar ' s budget, which fully funded creation of its engine. The Space Bar was announced in mid-February 1996, alongside Rocket Science's games Obsidian and Rocket Jockey .",

          "text": "One attempts to identify who was involved in a deviation from the recommended procedure, and the other attempts to identify why deviation from the recommended procedure seemed to be a good idea at the time. The first approach tends to apportion blame, on the assumption that the recommended procedure was, in fact, optimum, and the other aims to learn why the recommended procedure was not considered appropriate at the time. This second approach has been shown to be more productive of learning from the experience, but can only work within a just culture in which the people involved feel safe to discuss the details. Categories of error [ edit ] Reason categorizes how errors occur by analysing what causes a plan to fail. If a plan is good, but poorly executed, then failure is due to slips, lapses, trips or fumbles . If the plan itself is faulty, then failure is due to a mistake . If established or approved procedures or regulations are intentionally ignored, then a mistake can be categorised as a violation . Levels of performance [ edit ] These error categories relate to three levels of human performance: Skill-based: Routine, practiced tasks performed in a largely automatic fashion, with occasional conscious progress checks. Rule-based: If the automatic responses are unsuitable, a switch of level can be made where memorized performance patterns or rules are applied. These are structured on an If (situation), then do (actions) pattern, often similar to one from previous experience, and perceptions of the current situation are used to select an appropriate solution from memory. Potential solutions are developed through education, training, and experience, and are selected automatically from memory, but verified that they are appropriate by conscious thought. Knowledge-based: When solutions from memory do not suit the current situation, the fall back is to knowledge-based solutions, where the current situation must be analysed and a solution developed in real time. Performance is relatively slow and laborious and the process is subject to errors resulting from constraints of information, time, understanding, intelligence and distractions.",

          "text": "Ceremony [ edit ] Selection of children [ edit ] Children selected for sacrifice in capacocha ceremonies were of both sexes, and were provided to the state as tribute by local communities on a yearly basis. No region was exempt from the recruitment of these child sacrifices; they could come from any region of the empire. The male victims were no older than ten and girls could be up to age sixteen but must be virgin when chosen; they had to be perfect, unblemished by even a freckle or scar. The Inca believed that only the purest children were worthy enough to be sent to the gods, as in the afterlife they would function as the people's representatives. For many families it was a great honor to have one's child chosen for the ceremony, and it was often children from noble families that were sacrificed in an effort to gain political favor with the emperor. While the boys were immediately brought to Cuzco, the young girls, called aclla , taken for sacrifice were often entrusted to the mama-kuna , in the \"House of Chosen Women\" ( aqlla wasi ). Chosen for their looks, the girls stayed at this institution for an extended period of time and were taught, under the tutelage of priestesses, how to weave, sew, and prepare special ritual beverages called chicha . The mama-kuna women were compared to nuns by many Spanish men, as they lived celibate lives, serving the gods. Typically around the age of 14 the girls would be divided into three groups. Some girls were consecrated as priestesses and went on to raise the girls brought after them, and the prettiest were often sent as tribute to be sacrificed in state capacocha ceremonies. Otherwise, the girls were offered to the emperor in Cuzco as servants or concubines; or were distributed amongst the noblemen as secondary wives.",

Mr. Justice Brewer in the Holy Trinity case, supra , mentioned many of these evidences of religion, and Mr. Justice Douglas in the Zorach case referred to ...

To this list may be added tax exemption of churches, chaplaincies in the armed forces, the \"Pray for Peace\" postmark, the widespread observance of Christmas holidays, and, in classrooms, singing the fourth stanza of America which is prayer invoking the protection of God, and the words \"in God is our trust\" as found in the National Anthem, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, modified by an Act of Congress of June 14, 1954, to include the words \"under God. ^ Merriam, Jesse; Lupu, Ira; Elwood, F.; Davis, Eleanor; Tuttle, Robert; R., David; Kirschner, Sherry (2008-08-28). \"On Ceremonial Occasions, May the Government Invoke a Deity?\" .

It is generally thought that during the Cold War era, the government of the United States sought to distinguish itself from the Soviet Union , which promoted state atheism and thus implemented antireligious legislation , therefore, a debate for further usage of religious motto was started in Congress. Kevin M. Kruse offers an alternative explanation. In his book, he argues that conservative opposition to the New Deal , and those politicians' subsequent successful campaigns to expand the influence of religion, were the main factors that contributed to further adoption of \"In God We Trust\". The Eisenhower administration struck a deeply religious tone, which proved a fertile ground for lobbying for inclusion of the motto in more contexts. This is often attributed to the influence of Billy Graham , a prominent evangelist of the time. After intense public pressure for inclusion of the national motto, it appeared for the first time on some postage stamps of the 1954 Liberty Issue , though lobbying for universal inclusion by Michigan Senator Charles E. Potter and Representative Louis C. Rabaut failed. The following year, Democratic Representative Charles Edward Bennett of Florida cited the Cold War when he introduced H. R. 619, which obliged \"In God we trust\" to be printed on all banknotes and struck on all coins, in the House, arguing that \"[in] these days when imperialistic and materialistic communism seeks to attack and destroy freedom, we should continually look for ways to strengthen the foundations of our freedom\". The American Numismatic Association and the American Legion concurred and made resolutions urging to promote further usage of \"In God We Trust\". On July 11, 1955, the bill, having passed with bipartisan support of both chambers of Congress, was signed into law by President Eisenhower . Since all coins already complied with the law, the only changes were made to the paper currency.",

In June 2021, terms of the settlement were revealed, and it was disclosed that Franco, pending a judge's approval, would pay more than $2.2 million to resolve two legal disputes: One by the two women who cited sexual exploitation (they will receive $894,000). Another class-action case by approximately 1,500 Studio 4 students who maintain that they were defrauded. A joint statement by the plaintiffs and defendants reads in part: While Defendants continue to deny the allegations in the Complaint, they acknowledge that Plaintiffs have raised important issues; and all parties strongly believe that now is a critical time to focus on addressing the mistreatment of women in Hollywood. Charlyne Yi worked with Franco on The Disaster Artist . In April 2021, Yi stated that after they attempted to quit the film over the allegations against Franco, the filmmakers responded by offering them a larger role. Yi viewed this enticement as an attempted bribe and also accused Franco's long-time co-star Seth Rogen of enabling his behavior. A month later, Rogen commented on the allegations against Franco and said he does not condone abuse or harassment. On December 23, 2021, Franco admitted to having had sex with students and stated that he had undergone treatment for sexual addiction since 2016; he did not address other allegations of sexual misconduct. Philanthropy Franco has volunteered at the charity the Art of Elysium , which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade. On March 31, 2011, the actor took part in \"An Evening with James Franco\", a Washington D.C.",

There is a health clinic serving as a waiting place for them before they are about to go into labor. With the different atmosphere of hospitals and waiting clinics, and with differences between hospital staff and the indigenous women, there is a gap of misunderstanding of cultural tradition and the BJA's regulations. The progress women made with the CCT program is that they were able to gain self-confidence through financial services. They were able to have more control over the money inside the household. Also, indigenous women had access to their own documentation and for their children. This allowed them to be recognized by the Bolivian government in order for them to have the same rights as other citizens. The cash transfers were given to the women in order for them to take care of their children and their maternal health. It also gave them an opportunity to create a social network while moving to urban areas. The CCT program helped the welfare needs of the indigenous women. The CCT program did not pay much attention to the women's voice, give them more opportunities in order to move forward in the economy or could help them participate more as a community. There was a feeling of discrimination between the indigenous women and the staff workers, because the women did not speak Spanish and were not able to communicate effectively. The gender equity did not improve between men and women because the women were not able to improve their economic social status with the financial help they received. Crime against women [ edit ] Physical abuse and rape are the highest experienced crimes against women in Bolivia. A 1986 report from a hospital in La Paz stated that out of the 1,432 cases of rape and abuse, 66 percent were committed against women. 77.5 percent of those crimes were committed by husbands or family members, followed by 13 percent committed by strangers.",

          "text": "At the same time, claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated, for example by the inclusion of soil and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily, in the \"recycled\" column. In US states with recycling incentives, there is constant local pressure to inflate recycling statistics. Recycling has been separated from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the computer industry where worldwide millions of PC's are disposed of as electronic waste each year in 2016 44.7 million metric tons of electronic waste was generated of which only 20% was documented and recycled. Some computer manufacturers refurbish leased computers for resale. Community Organizations have also entered this space by refurbishing old computers from donation campaigns for distribution to undeserved communities. Software recycling [ edit ] A clear example of the difference between zero waste and recycling is discussed in Getting to Zero Waste , in the software industry. Zero waste design can be applied to intellectual property where the effort to code functionality into software objects is developed by design as opposed to copying code snippets multiple times when needed. The application of zero waste is straightforward as it conserves human effort. Also, software storage mediums have transitioned from consumable diskettes to internal drives which are vastly superior and have a minimal cost per megabyte of storage. This is a physical example where zero waste correctly identifies and avoids wasteful behavior. Use of zero waste system [ edit ] Zero waste is poorly supported by the enactment of government laws to enforce the waste hierarchy . A special feature of zero waste as a design principle is that it can be applied to any product or process, in any situation or at any level. Thus it applies equally to toxic chemicals as to benign plant matter. It applies to the waste of atmospheric purity by coal-burning or the waste of radioactive resources by attempting to designate the excesses of nuclear power plants as \" nuclear waste \".",

          "text": "Special TEMPEST shielding can mitigate this effect. Such radiation of a potentially exploitable signal, however, occurs also with other display technologies and with electronics in general. Recycling [ edit ] Due to the toxins contained in CRT monitors the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created rules (in October 2001) stating that CRTs must be brought to special e-waste recycling facilities. In November 2002, the EPA began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through landfills or incineration . Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment. As electronic waste , CRTs are considered one of the hardest types to recycle. CRTs have relatively high concentration of lead and phosphors , both of which are necessary for the display. There are several companies in the United States that charge a small fee to collect CRTs, then subsidize their labor by selling the harvested copper, wire, and printed circuit boards . The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) includes discarded CRT monitors in its category of \"hazardous household waste\" but considers CRTs that have been set aside for testing to be commodities if they are not discarded, speculatively accumulated, or left unprotected from weather and other damage. Various states participate in the recycling of CRTs, each with their reporting requirements for collectors and recycling facilities. For example, in California the recycling of CRTs is governed by CALRecycle, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery through their Payment System. Recycling facilities that accept CRT devices from business and residential sector must obtain contact information such as address and phone number to ensure the CRTs come from a California source in order to participate in the CRT Recycling Payment System. In Europe, disposal of CRT TVs and monitors is covered by the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive). Multiple methods have been proposed for the recycling of CRT glass. The methods involve thermal, mechanical and chemical processes.",
