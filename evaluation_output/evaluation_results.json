She knows that that's part of the process and, for me, that gives me the confidence to try those passes\". Walsh repeated the sentiment in a press conference after she was voted player of the match in England's first game after the Euro, a 2–0 win over Austria that saw them qualify for the 2023 World Cup. With her appearance in the final qualification group game, another 10–0 win over Luxembourg on 6 September 2022, Walsh won her 50th England cap. As European champions, England contested the 2023 Women's Finalissima in April 2023, defeating Copa América champions Brazil on penalties to win 1–1 (4–2 ( p )), with Walsh being named player of the match. Walsh was part of the squad for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, which began in July 2023. Early in their second match she suffered a knee injury when winning the ball back; rather than try to directly replace her, England drastically and successfully changed formation for their next match. She suffered ligament damage, though not an ACL injury as many were concerned, and managed to return after missing only one game. The new formation was retained by the squad for most of the tournament, though it limited Walsh, whose creative play was stifled against Nigeria . She was more commanding and influential in the quarter- and semi-final wins over Colombia and Australia , performing reliably to help the Lionesses reach a World Cup final for the first time. In the final , Walsh suffered against Spain's creative midfield, her performance described in The Telegraph as \"very poor ... by her standards\". England lost 0–1, to win silver.",

          "text": "Biennial world amateur team golf championship The Espirito Santo Trophy (World Women's Amateur Team Championships) is a biennial world amateur team golf championship for women organised by the International Golf Federation . The inaugural event was held in 1964. It was instituted by the French Golf Federation in an agreement with the United States Golf Association . It was planned by Lally Segard , at the time known as Vicomtesse de Saint Sauveur, from France and Mrs. Henri Prunaret from America. Segard also asked her friends Ricardo and Silvia Espirito Santo, from Portugal , to donate a trophy for the event, which they did. They had originally bought the golden cup, which had belonged to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia , for an international Portuguese event that was not played anymore. The championship was held under the chairmanship of Segard at Golf de Saint Germain outside Paris, France . The week after, the World Amateur Golf Council agreed to manage and sponsor the tournament, beginning in 1966, to be played every second year, and Segard was appointed chairperson of the women's committee of the council. The Council changed its name to the International Golf Federation in 2003. Later tournaments have featured teams from around 50 ccountries. From 2023, the field has been restricted to 36 teams, qualified through different criteria. It is a stroke play event, in which the best two individual scores in each team count towards the final score. For the first three decades, the championship was dominated by the United States. Later results have reflected the increasing globalisation of women's golf, with six different winners in six events from 1996 to 2006, and several top two placings by teams from Asia . South Korea won four times from 1996 to 2016. The equivalent \"World Amateur Team Championship\" for men is the Eisenhower Trophy .",

Everything was going to be fine. – Molly Hudson, The Times , about the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 final In June 2022, Walsh was named to the England squad for the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 in July, which they won. Though ill to the point of requiring a nebuliser before the opening game, Walsh started every match, playing all but five minutes. She showed what Liew described as \"classic understated dominance\" and was key throughout the tournament, including mounting England's comeback quarter-final win over Spain . In anticipation of the final against Germany it was reported that the outcome of the match could come down to whether Walsh or her contrasting counterpart Lena Oberdorf outperformed the other. England won 2–1, with Walsh providing the lauded pass for England's first goal scored by Ella Toone in the 62nd minute; The New York Times covered the match by saying it \"was Walsh's game\". She was named player of the match and was subsequently included in the Team of the Tournament . Considered instrumental in England's victory, and described in the media as the unsung hero of the tournament and her team, other players and the media reacted with surprise when Walsh did not receive a nomination for the Ballon d'Or Féminin in August 2022. During the 2022 Euro campaign, Walsh reflected that she was able to perform so consistently because of Wiegman's coaching style allowing Walsh to have a good mindset, that Wiegman \"[is] not bothered that we make mistakes. ...",

History of the Hotak Dynasty [ edit ] Rise to power and Reign of Mirwais Hotak [ edit ] Decline of the Safavids [ edit ] The Shi'a Safavids ruled Loy Kandahar as their easternmost territory from the 16th century until the early 18th century. At the same time, the native Afghan tribes living in the area were Sunni Muslims . Immediately to the east was the powerful Sunni Mughal Empire , who occasionally fought wars with the powerful Safavids over the territory of southern Afghanistan. The Khanate of Bukhara controlled the area to the north at the same time. By the late 17th century, the Safavids started to decline. With the death of Shah Abbas in 1629, succeeding Safavid rulers were less effective and caused the empire to decline. On 29 July 1694, Shah Suleiman died and Sultan Husayn took the throne. Under his reign the problems worsened. Husayn barely left the palace during his reign, not an uncommon aspect of many later Safavid Shahs. Later Safavid rulers were immobile and their courts were riddled with factionalism unlike their more mobile ancestors who spent more time on campaigns and had smaller courts.

It was established in 1709 by Mirwais Hotak , who led a successful rebellion against the declining Persian Safavid empire in the region of Loy Kandahar (\"Greater Kandahar\") in what is now southern Afghanistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of natural causes and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded him. He did not reign long as he was killed by his nephew Mahmud , who overthrew the Safavid Shah and established his own rule over Iran. Mahmud in turn was succeeded by his cousin Ashraf following a palace coup in 1725. Ashraf also did not retain his throne for long, as the Iranian conqueror Nader-Qoli Beg (later Shah ), under the resurgent Safavid banner, defeated him at the Battle of Damghan in 1729. Ashraf Hotak was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan, limiting Hotak rule to just a small corner of their once large empire. Hotak rule came to an end in 1738, when Nader Shah defeated Ashraf's successor Hussain Hotak after the lengthy siege of Kandahar . Subsequently, Nader Shah began re-establishing Iranian suzerainty over regions lost to Iran's archrivals, the Ottoman and Russian Empires , decades earlier.",

North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuruí Dam , which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory. As of July 2022, according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%. While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%; the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior. In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country. In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current demand. In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW), and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany. Nuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity. The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A) , a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás . Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra . It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis , Rio de Janeiro .",

          "text": "At the same time, a contract to build the three-phase AC distribution system the project needed was awarded to General Electric. The early to mid-1890s saw General Electric, backed by financier J. P. Morgan , engaged in costly takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric. The competition was so costly that in 1896 a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies. The agreement stayed in effect until 1911. Following the success of the first Niagara Falls plant, the Rankine Generating Station , also known as The Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station, the Canadians contracted with Westinghouse for eleven 25 Hertz generators of the same Tesla-inspired design, rated for a total generating capacity of 100 MW. That facility opened in 1905 in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Other Westinghouse projects: steam engines, maritime propulsion, and shock absorbers [ edit ] Despite continuing success in his other businesses, Westinghouse's main interest shifted to electric power generation. At the outset, the available generating sources were hydro turbines where falling water was available, and reciprocating steam engines where it was not. Westinghouse felt that existing reciprocating steam engines were clumsy and inefficient, and he wanted to develop rotating engines that would be more elegant. His first patent had been for a rotary steam engine, but it proved impractical at the time. In 1884, the British engineer Charles Algernon Parsons at Clarke, Chapman and Co began experimenting with steam turbines and generators, producing a 10-horsepower (7.5 kW) turbo-generator. In 1895, Westinghouse bought rights to the Parsons turbine, and his engineers improved its technology and increased its scale. In 1898, Westinghouse demonstrated a 300-kilowatt generating unit, replacing reciprocating engines in his air-brake factory.",

Suffocated. Crushed. Incinerated. Mothers trying to protect their children with only their bodies. Old people with no strength left to flee from the flames. These pictures are still alive in our memory, and our accounts capture indelibly what we went through. For decades we—and survivors from many other nations—have been scarred by the horror, loss and injuries we experienced in the wars of the 20th century. Today we see that the beginnings of the 21st century are also marked by suffering and destruction. On behalf of all the victims of war throughout the world we express our sympathy and solidarity with all those affected by the terror of 11 September in the US and the war in Afghanistan. But is that very suffering now also to be inflicted upon the people of Iraq? Must thousands more die in a rain of bombs, must cities and villages be destroyed and cultural treasures obliterated?",

          "text": "The grey-necked rockfowl is monogamous and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies of two to five nests, though one colony of forty nests has been recorded. These nests are constructed out of mud and are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces, typically in caves or on cliffs. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide exists in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month. This species is classified as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction . A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl is considered one of Africa's most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range. Taxonomy [ edit ] This species was first described by Anton Reichenow in 1899 from a bird collected at the base of Mount Cameroon near Limbe, Cameroon . He published his description in Ornithologische Monatsberichte and described it as Picathartes oreas . The generic name was first used by René-Primevère Lesson in 1828 after he split the grey-necked rockfowl's close relative the white-necked rockfowl from the crow genus Corvus and placed it in its own genus, Picathartes , as the white-necked rockfowl did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head. This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for \"magpie\" and cathartes for \"vulture\". The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek word oreas , meaning \"mountain\".",

Home front [ edit ] Main article: Australian home front during World War II See also: Department of Munitions and Small Arms Ammunition Factory Workers inspecting practice bombs at a factory in South Australia during 1943 During the war the Australian Government greatly expanded its powers in order to better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Allied armed forces. The expansion of the government's powers began on 9 September 1939, when the National Security Act became law. This act enabled the government to introduce industrial conscription, and both men and women were ordered into essential industries. Rationing was first introduced in 1940, and was greatly expanded during 1942. The Government also strongly encouraged austerity and war bonds as a means of reducing demand for scarce resources. Government policies to develop war-related industries were successful in increasing the sophistication of Australia's industrial sector and self-sufficiency in most categories of weapons.",

          "text": "As the previous election took place on 26 March 2017, the next election was required to take place before April 2022. Electoral system [ edit ] The 51 members of the Landtag are elected via closed list proportional representation using the d'Hondt method . 41 seats are distributed in three multi-member constituencies, and the remaining ten at the state level. An electoral threshold of 5% of valid votes is applied to the Landtag; parties that fall below this threshold are ineligible to receive seats. Background [ edit ] Main article: 2017 Saarland state election In the previous election held on 26 March 2017, the CDU remained the largest party with 40.7% of votes cast, an increase of 5.5 percentage points . The SPD declined slightly to 29.6%. The Left fell to 12.8%, a decline of 3.3 points. Alternative for Germany (AfD) contested its first election in Saarland, winning 6.2%. The Greens lost their representation in the Landtag with a result of 4.0%. The CDU had led a grand coalition with the SPD since 2012 under Minister-President Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer , which was renewed after the election. Kramp-Karrenbauer resigned as Minister-President after her, ultimately unsuccessful, entry into federal politics in February 2018, and was succeeded by Tobias Hans as Minister-President in March and as state CDU leader in October 2018. Even though the Saarland is the second smallest state by population and does not represent Germany as a whole demographically, the election proved to be of pivotal importance to the following state elections and in particular the federal election later that year . New SPD lead candidate Martin Schulz led the party to a resurgence nationally in early 2017, and polls showed the SPD within striking distance of winning in Saarland.",

Internally designated the Type 14 (1955–1975), the Type 34 (1962–1969), and the Type 145 TC (1972–1975; Brazil), the Karmann Ghia cars combined the floorpans and mechanicals of the Type 1 / Beetle or Type 3 'ponton' models with styling by Italy's Carrozzeria Ghia , and hand-built bodywork by German coachbuilding house Karmann . The 1955 Type 14 Karmann Ghia was just the second Volkswagen passenger car ever produced, after the Beetle, and launched six years before the Type 3 notchbacks, fastbacks and Variants (squarebacks). They were faster and more expensive than the Beetle, but very cramped in the back, despite their wider, postwar and nearly slabsided body design. Two years later, in 1957, a convertible was added. In 1961, the Karmann Ghia briefly lost its title of fastest Volkswagen, upon launch of the more powerful 1500cc Type 3 models, but later that year, Volkswagen, Ghia, and Karmann presented an all new Karmann Ghia – Type 34 , using the Type 3's floorpan and 1500cc powertrain . Made from 1962 to 1969, this had both new, more modern, angular and roomier bodywork; and a new, more luxurious interior, making it substantially more expensive than all other VW passenger cars. Additionally, the Type 34 was one of the world's first cars with a power operated steel sunroof option.",

The largest patron body of Gaelscoileanna in the Republic of Ireland is An Foras Pátrúnachta , although the vast majority of schools under their patronage are at primary level. Sign for primary Gaelscoil in Newry , Northern Ireland County Dublin has over 50 Irish language-medium schools attended by over 13,000 pupils. Students in the Gaelscoileanna acquire the Irish language through language immersion , and study the standard curriculum through it. Gaelscoileanna, unlike English-medium schools , have the reputation of producing competent Irish speakers. English-medium schools, in contrast, produce relatively few fluent Irish speakers , despite the Irish language being an obligatory subject in the Republic of Ireland in both primary and secondary school. This has been attributed in part to the lack of Irish-language immersion programs.",

Two new second-level gaelscoileanna opened in Ireland in 2014: Coláiste Ghlór na Mara in Balbriggan and Gaelcholáiste an Phiarsaigh in Rathfarnham (both in County Dublin ). Gaelcholáiste Charraig Uí Leighin opened in Carrigaline and Northern Ireland 's second gaelcholáiste Gaelcholáiste Dhoire opened in Dungiven Castle in 2015. Gaelcholáiste Mhic Shuibhne opened in Knocknaheeney in 2019. Gaelcholáiste Mhaigh Nuad opened in Maynooth in September 2020. Gaelcholáistí are supported and represented on a practical day-to-day basis by Gaeloideachas (who also support Irish-medium schools in the Gaeltacht) and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta & Gaelscolaíochta (whose name translates into English as \"The Council for Gaeltacht and Gaelscoileanna Education\") or COGG in the Republic of Ireland and by Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta in Northern Ireland. In 2023 An Foras Pátrúnacha revealed that there is a demand for 7 new Gaelcholáistí in the Republic of Ireland and in 2021 Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta revealed that there is a demand for 3 new Gaelcholáistí in Northern Ireland.",

          "text": "English-medium schools, in contrast, produce relatively few fluent Irish speakers , despite the Irish language being an obligatory subject in the Republic of Ireland in both primary and secondary school. This has been attributed in part to the lack of Irish-language immersion programs. Gaelscoileanna and Irish language-medium schools in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented by Gaeloideachas and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta & Gaelscolaíochta or COGG in the Republic of Ireland and by Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta in Northern Ireland. Gaelscoileanna have undergone a striking expansion over the last few decades, although there are now concerns that rules limiting the founding of new schools are affecting the establishment of new Irish-medium education in areas where there is competition amongst educational patrons. Their success is due to effective (though limited) community support and an efficient administrative infrastructure. They are distinguished by being the product, not of state policy, but of a genuine community movement. In 1972, there were only 11 such schools at primary level and five at secondary level in the Republic of Ireland . As of September 2023, there were 188 gaelscoileanna at primary level, attended by over 40,000 students, and 32 gaelcholáistí and 17 aonaid Ghaeilge (Irish language units) at secondary level, attended by over 12,000 students in non- Gaeltacht areas across Ireland . 35 of these primary schools, two of the postprimary schools and four of the postprimary units operated are in Northern Ireland. Additionally, some 4,000 children attend Irish-medium preschools or Naíonrai outside the Gaeltacht with around 1,000 children attending Naíonraí within the Gaeltacht.",

          "text": "A writer from The Guardian criticized the video, calling it \"wacky\" and describing Carey's choreography as \"running amok\". Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani felt the video was \"brilliantly over-the-top\", while an anonymous columnist from NME commented that it would cause male viewers to \"play with themselves\" after watching. In a countdown of \"The 5 Least Sexiest Music Videos\", Priya Elan from NME included the video at number three, writing how the singer \"spins with the mad-eyed grace of someone who hasn't been to sleep for 72 hours\" (referring to Carey's mention of insomnia as a reason for her breakdown). Japiya Burns of The Michigan Daily was critical of Carey's portrayal in the video, primarily her double-handkerchief bra. He felt that in doing so, Carey was cheapening herself and her image to resemble younger pop singers such as Britney Spears . Live performances [ edit ] At the time of its release, Carey did not perform \"Loverboy\" live. The first performance of the song came 5 months later at a private special concert for the US troops at Camp Bondsteele in Kosovo . Carey also performed her single at the time \" Never Too Far / Hero Medley \", \" My All \", a snippet of \" Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town \" and \" All I Want for Christmas Is You \". 15 years later, it was performed again on Carey's Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour in 2016, this time as part of the Car Ride medley. Three years later, it was also performed as part of the #JusticeForGlitter medley of Carey's Caution World Tour .

The first and last names of the abducted children are also changed, making it even more difficult to track down and identify the children. Ukraine's ombudsman on children's rights has said the process of tracking down abducted children is especially difficult with young children that may not remember where they are from. Even in cases where parents have successfully tracked down their children and formally applied to the Russian authorities to be reunited with them, Russian officials have attempted to pressure or persuade the parents and children to consent to transfer, promising creature comforts and a better life. In cases where parents (or other legal guardian) and children are unable to establish contact or parents are unable or unwilling to personally come collect the children, children are deported to Russia even if they personally express a desire to remain in Ukraine. Abducted children have been lied to by Russian officials about their parents having abandoned them. Funding For the year of 2024, according to an investigation published in February 2024 by a coalition of journals including VSquare , Delfi , Expressen and Paper Trail Media , Lvova-Belova was scheduled to be paid from the Russian Federation budget the equivalent of € 420,000 \"for the removal of children from the Special Military Occupation Zone\". Belarusian involvement The Belarusian state and state-affiliated organisations have actively participated in the forced transfers of Ukrainian children. Ukrainian children have been deported to Belarus where they are held in recreational camps. The National Anti-Crisis Management Group, a Belarusian organisation headed by Belarusian opposition figure Pavel Latushka , used open-source information to report in August 2023 that at least 2,100 Ukrainian children had been transferred to Belarus. According to Latushka, they were being held in summer camps administered by state-owned corporations.",

MST Game weather : 45 °F (7 °C), partly cloudy Game attendance : 76,824 Referee : Bill Vinovich TV announcers (CBS) : Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts and Evan Washburn Recap , Gamebook Brock Osweiler during the game Coming off their win over the Chargers, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West rematch against the Oakland Raiders . In the first half, the Broncos' defense held the Raiders' offense to −12 net yards of offense, and the Broncos' offense dominated the time of possession by a nearly 3–1 margin, but had to settle for four field goals by placekicker Brandon McManus – from 41 and 35 yards in the first quarter, and 29 and 20 yards in the second quarter. The latter field goal occurred after wide receiver Demaryius Thomas dropped a crucial pass in the end zone from quarterback Brock Osweiler with only four seconds before halftime. The Raiders got on the scoreboard on the initial possession of the second half, with quarterback Derek Carr connecting with wide receiver Seth Roberts on an 11-yard touchdown pass. Later in the third quarter, the Broncos were backed up to their own 2-yard line following a Raiders' punt, and three plays later, the Raiders pulled to within 12–9, when defensive end Khalil Mack forced a fumble off Osweiler in the end zone for a safety. The Broncos' forced another Raiders' punt, however, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, Emmanuel Sanders muffed a punt deep in Broncos' territory, and the Raiders capitalized three plays later, with Carr throwing a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mychal Rivera (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt).",

AC Milan won the 2010–11 Serie A and their 18th league title overall with a scoreless draw away to Roma on 7 May 2011. This result ensured that with two rounds remaining AC Milan's nearest rival Internazionale could only draw level on points, and AC Milan holds the tiebreaker based on their better head-to-head record. The result prompted celebrations at AC Milan's Piazza del Duomo . The trophy was presented at AC Milan's next home game on 14 May. It was AC Milan's first Scudetto since 2004 and it ended a run of five successive Serie A titles by their rival Internazionale. It was the first league title for manager Massimiliano Allegri , winning in his first year with AC Milan and who was for many a surprise choice as manager. AC Milan led the table for most of the season and secured the title with two games remaining. Notably, they defeated defending champions Internazionale twice during the season and also did the same to third place challenger Napoli . AC Milan were credited for strengthening their squad with Zlatan Ibrahimović and Robinho in the summer as well as picking up Antonio Cassano and Mark van Bommel in January. This would be the last Scudetto not won by Juventus until the 2020–21 Serie A .",

After each team traded punts, the Raiders were attempting to add to their lead, but placekicker Sebastian Janikowski missed wide left on a 43-yard field goal attempt with 5:27 remaining in the game. The Broncos were facing a 4th-and-5 at their own 38-yard line with 3:50 remaining in the game, but tight end Vernon Davis dropped a pass from Osweiler that would have been a first down. The Broncos' defense forced the Raiders to go three-and-out, while being forced to use two of their remaining three team timeouts. With 2:35 remaining, the Broncos had one last possession, but on the sixth play, another dropped 4th-down pass – this one by Thomas – sealed the Raiders' win. Notes The Broncos wore their alternate navy blue jerseys for this game.

With increasing confidence, al-Mansur marched his army out to provoke a pitched battle, but Abu Yazid refused the challenge. Finally, on 13 August the Fatimids stormed the rebel camp, and Abu Yazid's troops broke and fled. The victory proved doubly fortuitous for al-Mansur. Seeking support against the Fatimids, Abu Yazid had made contact with the Spanish Umayyads and recognized the suzerainty of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Rahman III . An Umayyad fleet had been dispatched to assist him, but when its commander heard news of the Fatimid victory at Kairouan, he turned back. Even in his victory dispatch to the capital, read out by the chamberlain Jawdhar, al-Mansur upheld the fiction of the still living al-Qa'im, describing himself merely as the \"Sword of the Imam\". The Fatimid ruler set about achieving a reconciliation with the citizens of Kairouan: he abstained from re-appointing an Isma'ili qadi over the city, instead choosing the old and respected Malikite jurist Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Manzur ; he did not appoint a Kutama as governor, but a military officer of Slavic origin, Qudam al-Fata; he remitted all taxes for two years; and offered much of the captured booty as alms to the city poor. At the same time, al-Mansur ordered that the site of his camp south of the city be made into a new palace city, known officially as al-Mansuriya and locally as Sabra.",

During its ninth anniversary celebration in 2013, Daniel Razon announced the network's ongoing transition from analog to digital broadcast. The activity includes upgrading of technical equipment and studio facilities. After a year, UNTV began its test broadcast in Metro Manila using its new digital transmitter in Antipolo. On October 2, 2014, UNTV began its simulcast test broadcast on UHF channel 38 (617.143 MHz) along with its analog broadcast on UHF channel 37. It has two standard definition (SD) channels and one 1seg or “oneseg” channel. 1seg is the common name of DTV service specifically for mobile phone devices. UNTV multi-channel line-up also includes one high definition (HD) channel called “ADDTV” or Ang Dating Daan TV showing purely religious programs. Its digital broadcast can be received in Metro Manila and nearby provinces like Bulacan, Pampanga, Cavite and Rizal, using ISDB-T set top boxes including LED TV sets and mobile devices with built-in ISDB-T tuners. In a DTV signal test conducted by Philippine mobile phone brand Starmobile last April 2015, UNTV was present in eight out of 14 locations in Metro Manila with decent signal strength of three up to the maximum of four signal bars. In April 2016, Anywave Communication Technologies Co. Ltd. announced that UNTV tapped Anywave for its implementation of analog and digital transmitters. Anywave is a manufacturer of television and radio transmission equipment with headquarters in Illinois, United States.",

          "text": "Finished network feeds are not considered backhauls, even if local insertion is used to modify the content prior to final transmission. There exists a dedicated group of enthusiasts who use TVRO (TV receive-only) gear such as satellite dishes to peek in on backhaul signals that are available on any of the dozens of broadcast satellites that are visible from almost any point on Earth. In its early days, their hobby was strengthened by the fact that most backhaul was analog and in the clear (unscrambled or unencrypted) which made for a vast smorgasbord of free television available for the technically inclined amateur. In recent years, full-time content and cable channels have added encryption and conditional access , and occasional signals are steadily becoming digital , which has had a deleterious effect on the hobby. Some digital signals remain freely accessible (sometimes using K u band dishes as small as one meter) under the international DVB-S standard or the US Motorola -proprietary Digicipher system. The small dishes may either be fixed (much like DBS antennas), positioned using a rotor (usually DiSEqC -standard) or may be toroidal in design (twin toroidal reflectors focus the incoming signal as a line, not a point, so that multiple LNBs may receive signal from multiple satellites). A blind-search receiver is often used to try every possible combination of frequency and bitrate to search for backhaul signals on individual communication satellites. Documentaries containing backhauled content [ edit ] The 1992 documentary Feed was compiled almost entirely using unedited backhaul from political campaign coverage by local and network television. A similar documentary about the 1992 U.S. presidential election named Spin was made in the same way in 1995. References [ edit ] External links [ edit ] LyngSat Spin at IMDb Retrieved from \" \"",

In May 1915 he was sent to lead a raid into Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), and in October Lettow placed him in charge of the troops in the west of German East Africa. This was effectively an independent command, as it was impossible for Wahle to maintain regular contact with Lettow, who was operating in the north and east of the colony. Early in 1916 the Belgian troops from the Congo began a large-scale invasion of German East Africa, and Wahle was obliged to fall back to Tabora, and then retreat slowly in a southeasterly direction. Wahle led his forces through arid, largely uninhabited country, up into the highlands of Uhehe, which were already occupied by the British. To those who knew the terrain, this operation was regarded as a master stroke. Wahle's troops then breached the British lines and descended to the Kilombero valley, where they were reunited with Lettow's troops in November 1916. Wahle was given command of the German forces in this area, but in April 1917 Lettow transferred him to the Lindi front, where he led the dogged German retreat up the Lukuledi valley. In October he was battlefield commander at the murderous Battle of Mahiwa . In November 1917 Lettow led all his remaining troops across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese East Africa (now Mozambique). Here the problem of provisioning became particularly acute. Lettow split his force into two, to permit more extensive foraging, and thus Wahle again exercised an independent command for some time. On 8 December 1917 Wahle's detachment seized the Portuguese fort at Mount Mecula .",

          "text": "United Nations UNICEF Emergency Programs Director Manuel Fontaine told CBS News that UNICEF was \"looking into how we can track or help on that\", though stating they did not have ability to investigate at the moment. Michelle Bachelet , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , announced on 15 June 2022 that her agency had started an investigation into allegations of children forcibly deported from Ukraine to the Russian Federation. On 15 March 2023, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a report declaring these forced transfers of children are illegal and a war crime. It broadly gave three categories of deported children: those who lost contact with their parents due to the Russian invasion, those who were separated when their parents were sent to a Russian filtration camp , and those who were in institutions. The report concluded: International humanitarian law prohibits the evacuation of children by a party to the armed conflict, with the exception of a temporary evacuation where compelling reasons relating to the health or medical treatment of the children or, except in occupied territory, their safety, so requires. The written consent of parents or legal guardians is required. In none of the situations which the Commission has examined, transfers of children appear to have satisfied the requirements set forth by international humanitarian law. The transfers were not justified by safety or medical reasons. There seems to be no indication that it was impossible to allow the children to relocate to territory under Ukrainian Government control... The Commission has concluded that the situations it has examined concerning the transfer and deportation of children, within Ukraine and to the Russian Federation respectively, violate international humanitarian law, and amount to a war crime .",

Other colleges (notably at that point University College and Mansfield College ) also joined the emerging group of teams within the university. The standard rulebook of the International Quidditch Association was officially adopted during the Trinity (summer) term of 2012. After the Global Games were held in Oxford in 2012, Oxford organised its first match against another university, defeating Reading in a home fixture on 24 November 2012. A few months later, Oxford played Leicester in another home fixture in University Parks, and won all three matches played by scores of 90-40*, 60-40*, and 120*-40. This was followed by Oxford's first tournament success, claiming the Highlander Cup in March 2013 after winning against Bangor in near-unplayable weather conditions in Edinburgh . A new order and the first British Champions [ edit ] The Whiteknights Tournament in Reading saw the Radcliffe Chimeras take first place, whilst the Quidlings struggled, finishing last. Along with the adoption of a two-team structure, the executive committee structure was also changed, with Ashley Cooper taking over from founder Angus Barry as captain of the Radcliffe Chimeras, as well as being installed as the club's first president. This change was followed by the inaugural British Quidditch Cup in November 2013. Hosted in Oxford, at the University Parks, the British Quidditch Cup was the first national championship within the United Kingdom, and sixteen teams, including the Radcliffe Chimeras and the Quidlings, took part.",

The organisers of the event, Luke Twist and Jasiek Mikolajczak, were later nominated as Radcliffe Chimeras captain and President respectively, following the announcement that Ashley Cooper would not be continuing his time as president or captain.

Renewed success: the 2024-25 season [ edit ] In the 2024-25 season, Oxford was coached by Luckeciano Melo, had president Maria Mahony, and was captained by Russell Bartram. OUQC played in both southern cups, as well as the British Quadball Cup (BQC), and had their most successful season in recent times. In their first tournament of the year in November 2024, after having a great recruitment season to see a squad filled with several promising newcomers to the sport, they placed joint second in the Southern Development Cup, hosted by Warwick, after losing a hard-fought game against Warwick QC , in which Oxford managed to catch the flag but unfortunately their goal deficit was too large to make up.

Operation of VR-1000-era machines required the skills of a highly trained video engineer . When a tape was changed, the operator spent as much as half-an-hour, \"lining-up\" the VTR—that is, carrying out specialized technical adjustments to calibrate the machine to the tape before it was ready for playback. From VR-1200/2000 onward, improvements in head manufacturing/refurbishing tolerances, timebase correction, and greater thermal stability of solid-state electronics made tape changes possible in under a minute and needed servo calibrations only once per shift. From AVR-1 onward, servos were self-calibrating and tape changes were as fast as the operator could articulate threading.

The format uses 2-inch-wide (51 mm) magnetic tape and was developed and released for the broadcast television industry in 1956 by Ampex , an American company based in Redwood City, California . The first videotape recorder using this format was built the same year. This format revolutionized broadcast television operations and television production , since the only recording medium available to the TV industry until then was motion picture film . Since most United States network broadcast delays by the television networks at the time used kinescope film that took time to develop, the networks wanted a more practical, cost-effective, and quicker way to time-shift television programming for later airing in Western time zones than the expensive and time-consuming processing and editing of film. Faced with these challenges, broadcasters sought to adapt magnetic tape recording technology (already used for audio recording) for use with television as well. By 1954 the television industry in the US was consuming more film stock than all Hollywood studios combined. The term \"quadruplex\" refers to the use of four magnetic record/play heads mounted on a headwheel spinning transversely (width-wise) across the tape at a rate of 14,386 RPM (for 960 recorded stripes per second) for NTSC 525 lines/30fps -standard quad decks and at 15,000 RPM (for 1,000 stripes per second) for those using the PAL 625 lines/25fps video standard. This method is called quadrature scanning, as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape formats.",

          "text": "This method is called quadrature scanning, as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape formats. The tape ran at a speed of either 7.5 or 15 in (190.5 or 381.0 mm) per second; the audio, control, and cue tracks were recorded in a standard linear fashion near the edges of the tape. The cue track was used either as a second audio track, or for recording cue tones or time code for linear video editing . The quadruplex format employs segmented recording; each transversely recorded video track on a 2-inch quad videotape holds one-sixteenth (NTSC) or one-twentieth (PAL) of a field of interlaced video. (For NTSC systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field.) This meant that 2-inch quad did not support \"trick-play\" functions, such as still, shuttle, and reverse or variable-speed playback. In fact, the quadruplex format could only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape was playing at normal speed. However, it was capable of producing extremely high-quality images with a horizontal resolution of about 400 lines per picture height , and remained the de facto industry standard for television broadcasting from its inception in 1956 to the mid-1980s, when newer, smaller, and lower-maintenance videotape formats such as Type C videotape superseded it. There were three different variations of 2-inch quad: Low-band, which was the first variety of quad introduced by Ampex in 1956, High-band, which used a wider bandwidth for recording video to the tape, resulting in higher-resolution video from the video tape recorder (VTR), and Super high-band, which used a pilot tone for better timebase stability, and higher coercivity tape.",

          "text": "Ammianus Marcellinus , (325/330-after 391) served as a Greco-Roman historian in 4th century CE , He described “the men of Egypt are mostly brown and black with a skinny and desiccated look.” Arrian , Greek historian, wrote in the 1st-century AD that \"The appearance of the inhabitants is also not very different in India and Ethiopia: the southern Indians are rather more like Ethiopians as they are black to look on, and their hair is black; only they are not so snub-nosed or woolly-haired as the Ethiopians; the northern Indians are most like the Egyptians physically\". According to a passage sourced from Strabo , Greek geographer, 1st-century AD , northern Indians held similar physical characteristics as the Egyptians: \"As for the people of India, those in the south are like the Aethiopians in colour, although they are like the rest in respect to countenance and hair (for on account of the humidity of the air their hair does not curl), whereas those in the north are like the Aegyptians\". Secondary interpretation of these historical descriptions have remained a source of academic contention. Professor of African Studies at Temple University, Molefi Kete Asante has referenced other examples from Herodotus's primary account for which he interprets to describe the physical appearance of Egyptians as Africans. This has included the following sourced statements \"the flooding of the Nile could not be caused by snow, because the natives of the country (Egypt) are black from the heat\" and descriptions of an oracle as Egyptian based on Dodoneans \"calling the dove black,[which] they indicated that the woman was Egyptian\".",

          "text": "The evidence of both language and culture reveals these African roots. The origins of Egyptian ethnicity lay in the areas south of Egypt\". Nancy Lovell wrote in 1999 that studies of skeletal remains indicate that the physical characteristics of ancient southern Egyptians and Nubians were \"within the range of variation\" for both ancient and modern indigenous peoples of the Sahara and tropical Africa, and that the distribution of population characteristics \"seems to follow a clinal pattern from south to north\", which may be explained by natural selection as well as gene flow between neighboring populations. Lovell outlined that \"In general, the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and Nubia had the greatest biological affinity to people of the Sahara and more southerly areas\". She also wrote that the archaeological and inscriptional evidence for contact between Egypt and Syro-Palestine \"suggests that gene flow between these areas was very likely\", and that the early Nile Valley populations were \"part of an African lineage, but exhibiting local variation\". Stuart Tyson Smith wrote in 2001: \"Any characterization of race of the ancient Egyptians depends on modern cultural definitions, not on scientific study. Thus, by modern American standards it is reasonable to characterize the Egyptians as 'black', while acknowledging the scientific evidence for the physical diversity of Africans.\" He continues: \"Ancient Egyptian practices show strong similarities to modern African cultures including divine kingship, the use of headrests, body art, circumcision, and male coming of-age rituals, all suggesting an African substratum or foundation for Egyptian civilisation\". Smith also wrote in 2004: \"Egyptian art depicts Nubians with stereotypical dark skin, facial features, hairstyles, and dress, all very different from Egyptians and the other two ethnic groups, Asiatics and Libyans\". He adds that \"no single material correlate, no matter how abundantly represented, unambiguously reflects ethnic group affiliation\".",

Club gave the episode an \"A\" grade and wrote, \"In all, 'Save My Love' felt like the back-half of an unofficial two-parter, throwing us right into Winona's sticky situation and amping up the suspense from there. And none of tonight's thriller payoffs would have been possible without the set-up of last week's episode, which I now confess to have underrated. Such are the hazards of the trade: Apologies in advance for doing it again in the near future. It's inevitable.\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \"But damn if I wasn't hooked throughout 'Save My Love,' an extremely tense – and at times darkly comic – hour demonstrating the many different ways the world had of letting Raylan and Winona know it wasn't going to be easy to put that money back.\" Todd VanDerWerff of Los Angeles Times wrote, \"The latest episode of Justified , 'Save My Love,' is an expert example of how to build tension in an hour of television. Immensely entertaining and filled with all sorts of incredible twists and turns, the episode shows off just how adroit Justified has become about backing its characters into corners and seeing if they can figure a way out of their predicaments. A sure sign of cracking good drama is when it seems like the writers are as much at a loss as the characters about what to do - yet they keep piling on the problems because that's likely what would happen if it were a real-life situation.",

          "text": "Public school in the United States Girls' High School was one of seven schools opened in 1872 as part of the original public school system in Atlanta , Georgia , US. Girls' High began in the John Neal/William Lyon Mansion, used by General William T. Sherman as his headquarters during his occupation of Atlanta. The site of the mansion at Mitchell and Washington Streets is now occupied by City Hall . A superb school academically, Girls' High was the only public high school in Atlanta exclusively for girls. Seventy-one girls received diplomas from the school at the graduation exercises in May 1911. In 1919, two graduates received scholarships for Barnard College . In 1925, Girls' High School moved into one of 18 new buildings in the 14th district, paid for by a massive bond issue. The school boasted the following amenities: 104 rooms, including science halls, laboratories, a business department, sewing rooms, a library, an art department, music room, and outdoor classrooms on the third level A model apartment containing a living/dining room, bedroom, bath and kitchenette 20 classrooms and individual offices for 39 teachers A school bank cage, part of the business department, which encouraged the girls to save and simultaneously gave them an opportunity to learn the banking business In 1947, Atlanta high schools became co-educational and Girl's High was renamed Roosevelt High School for US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . The school continued until 1985, when it combined with Hoke Smith Technical School . A new school building, Maynard Jackson High, was built on Glenwood Avenue just below the old Girl's High, where it still stands today. Since then, the original building has been converted into an apartment complex.

It was noted by Andy Taylor in his book Wild Boy that tensions had arisen between the group's management and himself, and he was also diagnosed with clinical depression connected with the death of his father. Dom Brown , who had previously toured with the band, again took over guitar duties and has been performing with them since. After Taylor's departure, the band scrapped the Reportage album. They wrote and recorded a new album titled Red Carpet Massacre (2007), which included the Timbaland tracks. Dom Brown is the featured guitarist on the album. In July 2007, the band performed twice at Wembley Stadium . Their first appearance at the stadium was the Concert for Diana which celebrated the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. The band performed \" (Reach Up for The) Sunrise \", \" The Wild Boys \" and \" Rio \". Their second appearance was at Live Earth concert, London . On 25 September, the Timberlake collaboration \" Falling Down \" was released as a download single on iTunes , and the band announced that they would play nine shows at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway to launch the Red Carpet Massacre album. The album launch was later extended to incorporate a show in London on 3 December 2007 and one in Dublin on 5 December 2007. In May 2008, they toured the US leg of their 2008 world tour and were supported by the British band Your Vegas . In June 2008, they played the Louvre in Paris in a fundraising effort that contributed to the restoration of a Louis XV drawing room. Guests dined, privately viewed some of the museum's artworks, then attended a performance by the band in the I.M. Pei -designed Pyramid du Louvre .",

In September 1979, this incarnation of the band recorded a four-track demo including an early version of \" Girls on Film \" co-written by Andy Wickett. Soon afterwards Alan Curtis was recruited as lead guitarist. After a few gigs with this line-up Wickett left the band in late 1979. Wickett was replaced by Roger Taylor's friend and former singer of The Scent Organs Jeff Thomas. In early 1980, they became the resident band at the city's Rum Runner nightclub. They were doing jobs at the club and began rehearsing and regularly playing at the venue. Curtis was unhappy with the Rum Runner club scene and left the band to form Dif Juz with his brother. Thomas was fired shortly after following disagreements and repeated arguments. The three remaining members started to look for a new lead vocalist and guitarist. The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band's management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys (DJs) and barmen when they were not rehearsing, and also formed the Tritec Music company. In April 1980, guitarist Andy Taylor came from Newcastle upon Tyne to audition after responding to an advertisement in Melody Maker . Andy already had a lot of experience from playing with cover bands for years and although he came from a totally different rock music background his versatile playing style was seen as a perfect complement to the band. In May 1980, London vocalist and drama student Simon Le Bon was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the Rum Runner.",

          "text": "Self-complementary adeno-associated virus ( scAAV ) is a viral vector engineered from the naturally occurring adeno-associated virus (AAV) to be used as a tool for gene therapy . Use of recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been successful in clinical trials addressing a variety of diseases. This lab-made progeny of rAAV is termed \"self-complementary\" because the coding region has been designed to form an intra-molecular double-stranded DNA template. A rate-limiting step for the standard AAV genome involves the second-strand synthesis since the typical AAV genome is a single-stranded DNA template. However, this is not the case for scAAV genomes: upon infection, rather than waiting for cell mediated synthesis of the second strand, the two complementary halves of scAAV will associate to form one double stranded DNA (dsDNA) unit that is ready for immediate replication and transcription , crucially allowing for faster expression of the viral payload. The caveat of this expediated construction is that instead of the full coding capacity found in rAAV (4.7–6 kb ) scAAV can only hold about half of that amount (≈2.4kb). In gene therapy application utilizing rAAV, the virus transduces the cell with a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) flanked by two inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). These ITRs form hairpins at the end of the sequence to serve as primers to initiate synthesis of the second strand before subsequent steps of infection can begin. The second strand synthesis is considered to be one of several blocks to efficient infection. Additional advantages of scAAV include increased and prolonged transgene expression in vitro and in vivo , as well as \"higher in vivo DNA stability and more effective circularization.\" In gene therapy [ edit ] scAAV is an attractive vector for use in gene therapy for many reasons.",

          "text": "By selectively mutating a panel of genes hypothesized to contribute to dosage compensation in worms, Meyer's group demonstrated which XSEs specifically play a role in determining normal dosage compensation. They found that during embryonic development, several X-linked genes—including sex-1, sex-2, fox-1, and ceh-39—act in a combinatorial fashion to selectively repress transcriptional activity of the xol-1 gene in hermaphrodites. Xol-1 expression is tightly regulated during early development, and is considered the most upstream gene in sex determination of C. elegans. In fact, xol-1 is often referred to in the literature as the master sex regulatory gene of C. elegans. XX C. elegans embryos have much lower xol-1 expression than their XO counterparts, resulting from overall increases in the amount of SEX-1, SEX-2, CEH-39, and FOX-1 transcription produced in the female embryos. This consequent decrease in xol-1 expression then allows higher SDC-2 expression levels, which aids in the formation and function of the DCC complex in the XX hermaphroditic worms, and in turn results in equalized expression of X-linked genes in the hermaphrodite. Though all of the above-mentioned XSEs act to reduce xol-1 expression, experimentally reducing expression levels of these individual XSEs has been shown to have a minimal effect on sex determination and successful dosage compensation. This could be in part because these genes encode different proteins that act cooperatively rather than in an isolated fashion; for example, SEX-1 is a nuclear hormone receptor, while FOX-1 is an RNA-binding protein with properties capable of inducing post-transcriptional modifications in the xol-1 target.",

Because the endogenous rep ORF has been replaced with transgene, exogenously provided rep genes encode the proteins required for genome replication and other viral life cycle components. The ITRs located 5' and 3' of the viral genome serve as the origin of replication. Viral packaging [ edit ] Like the rep ORF, scAAV's cap ORF has been replaced by transgene and therefore is provided exogenously in a lab environment. The genes encoded in this ORF build capsid proteins and are responsible (along with intracellular processing) for conveying target specificity. Rep proteins participate in the integration of the genome into preformed capsids. Despite the fact that scAAV is designed to form dsDNA upon infection, the two complementary strands are not packaged in a double stranded manner. Parvoviruses package their viral genome such that the ssDNA bases come in contact with the amino acids on the inside of the viral capsid. Thus the sequence of scAAV is likely unwound by a virally encoded DNA helicase before being packaged into viral protein capsid.

KCR was fully operational between 1964 and 1994, until it was abruptly shutdown in 1999. Since 2001, several restart attempts were sought and in November 2020, the KCR partially revived operations on the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan . With its hub at Karachi City station on I. I. Chundrigar Road , KCR's revived operations would extend north to Gadap , east to Dhabeji , south to Kiamari and west to Hub in Balochistan . The revived KCR operation is intended to become an inter-regional public transit system in Karachi , with an aim to connect the city centre with several industrial and commercial districts within the city and the outlying localities. Revival efforts for the KCR had been proposed multiple times since it became defunct in 1999, but remained unfulfilled mainly due to a lack of financial and political backing. In May 2017, the federal government approved a Rs. 27.9 billion (US$97 million) restoration package for the KCR, however delays and disputes with the Sindh provincial government ultimately led to the cancellation of the funding. Civil society has constantly fought for the revival of the KCR. Due to pressure both from outside and within government circles, a plan for its rehabilitation, financing, and implementation has been developed. In August 2020, the federal government approved a Rs. 10.5 billion (US$36 million) rehabilitation package for the KCR restoration.",

The group signed with S.M. Entertainment in 2003 and released their debut single \" Hug \" in January 2004, peaking at number four on the Monthly Albums Chart of the Music Industry Association of Korea (MIAK). Their following single \"The Way U Are\", released in June 2004, entered the MIAK Monthly Albums Chart at number one. In late 2004, TVXQ signed with Japan's Avex Group to launch their Japanese music career. They first issued the English version of \"Hug\" in November 2004, which was then followed by the release of their debut Japanese single \" Stay with Me Tonight \" in April 2005, peaking at number thirty-seven on the Oricon Singles Chart . They achieved their first top-three single in Japan the following year with \"Miss You / 'O'-Sei.Han.Gō.\", and in 2008, they scored their first number-one Japanese single with \" Purple Line \". Its accompanying studio album T spawned six top-five singles on the Oricon. In September 2008, TVXQ released their fourth Korean studio album Mirotic . The album's title single became one of TVXQ's biggest worldwide hits – it topped digital charts across most major Asian music markets, and became a signature song for the Hallyu . The group's fourth Japanese studio album The Secret Code , released in March 2009, repeated Mirotic's success, spawning four number-one singles on the Oricon.

          "text": "All Out is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event held by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) since 2019. It was originally held during Labor Day weekend and is one of AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, which also includes Double or Nothing , Full Gear , and Revolution , their four biggest domestic shows produced quarterly. On April 11, 2024, AEW announced that the sixth All Out event would take place on Sunday, September 1, 2024, at the Now Arena in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois . However, on May 21, 2024, AEW announced that All Out would instead take place a week later on Saturday, September 7, 2024, marking the first All Out to not be held during Labor Day weekend. This change came in response to fan concerns of the event being held only one week after All In , which had occurred the prior year. This subsequently returned the event to Saturday for the first time since 2020 as well as to the Now Arena, being the fourth overall at the venue, after 2019 , 2021 , and 2022 . Due to the event being held on Saturday, Collision and Rampage were held live back-to-back on Friday, September 6 in the Chicago area. Storylines [ edit ] All Out featured professional wrestling matches that were the result of pre-existing feuds and storylines , with results being predetermined by AEW's writers. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite , Collision , and Rampage . On the July 10 episode of Dynamite , Pac defeated Claudio Castagnoli , Kyle Fletcher , and Tomohiro Ishii in a Global Glory Four-Way match to earn an AEW International Championship match at All Out.",

          "text": "In commonwealth countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia where a coroners inquest is usually held, experts are often called in, evidence is gathered and is made publicly available. The chain of events starts with one or more triggering events which leads to the disabling agent (harmful event) , which causes the disabling injury, which leads to the cause of death, which in most cases is drowning, but a finding of drowning is, on its own, not usually useful to improve safety, simply because so many possible chains of events underwater lead to drowning. Learning from accidents [ edit ] The general recreational diving community's capacity for learning from accidents is limited by several factors, though this is not a universal trend: Uncertainty of risk [ edit ] Risk in diving is seldom known with any accuracy. The large amount of uncertainty regarding the probability of most forms of failure make it necessary for the diver or diving supervisor to estimate risk based on experience and what little data is available, often not much more than personal experience. Decisions based on these estimates tend to be affected by bias and circumstances. A dive that has required a major outlay in time and monetary cost, or which affects reputation, if cancelled, represents a definite loss, which when balanced against a possible loss of unknown probability, may induce the team to take a greater risk than if the perceived loss due to cancellation were less, even when the likely consequences of the low probability consequences are relatively dire. There is a tendency for losses to have a bigger subjective value than gains, which pushes people to risk more to avoid a definite loss. Various cognitive biases may influence decisions whether or not to cancel a dive on site: Plan continuation bias and the sunk cost fallacy Availability bias Hindsight bias Overconfidence Dunning–Kruger effect . When one doesn't know what one doesn't know, incompetent decisions may be made without being aware of it.",

          "text": "While not being urged to avoid competition, women had few opportunities to compete in sport in Australia until the 1880s. After that point, new sporting facilities were being built around the country and many new sport clubs were created. During the 1900s in Australia, lacrosse became more socially acceptable for women to participate in. Subsequently, female participation rates rose in places like Queensland . In 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for medical reasons, some girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Soccer was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. Sports which were medically appropriate for all girls, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, were swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding. Australian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II . Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and had held competitions during the war. This structure survived in the post-war period. Women's sports were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.

Tanker boots have a significant disadvantage over traditional lace-up combat boots in that they provide comparatively little ankle support; however, for troops that fight sitting in an armoured vehicle, this is relatively unimportant. An unauthorized variant of the tanker boot is the cavalry boot, or ' cav boot ', which is higher above the ankle (in imitation of riding boots worn by the old horse cavalry ) and might be worn by soldiers assigned to armored cavalry squadrons and scout units. The cavalry boots are more commonly seen being worn by officers in armored cavalry units.

It was only on this date that the headquarters of the 148th completed its arrival near the front, in the vicinity of Krychaw , which was also the new location of Gerasimenko's headquarters. Meanwhile, the 496th Rifle Regiment had been encircled near Stary Bykhaw and forced to break out, with only some 400 personnel reaching friendly lines. As 13th Army withdrew and 2nd Panzer advanced, often on the same or parallel routes, Red Army troops sometimes caused havoc in the German \"rear\". On July 16 the 507th Regiment was reported as being on a long line from 24km south-southeast to 58km southeast of Mogilev, fighting as part of the 172nd Division's 747th Rifle Regiment. The city would finally fall on July 26, with the loss of the regiment. As Western Front had become unwieldy, on July 23 a new Central Front was formed, to include the reformed 3rd Army, 13th, and 21st Armies. The 148th remained in 45th Corps, which also contained the 6th , 121st , and 137th Rifle Divisions. 13th Army was now under command of Maj. Gen. K. D. Golubev . Central Front was intended to cover the junction between Western and Southwestern Fronts while also operating toward Gomel and Babruysk.",

The 28th Division—just like the 9th before it (and the 4th Infantry Division, which would relieve the 28th)—also took heavy casualties during its stay in the Hürtgen Forest. On 14 November, the 2nd Ranger Battalion arrived to relieve elements of the 112th Infantry Regiment. On 6 December, the Rangers moved on Bergstein and subsequently took the strategic position of Hill 400 from defending troops from 980th Grenadier Regiment of the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division . Shortly thereafter, on 12 December, the towns of Gey and Strass were taken by American Forces. On the last day of the Hürtgen battle the Germans retook the hill from the 13th Regiment who had replaced the Rangers. The U.S. Army would not seize Hill 400 again until February 1945. From 1–12 December, the 309th, 310th and 311th Infantry Regiments of the 78th Infantry Division (\"Lightning\") relieved elements of the 1st Infantry Division in the line in the vicinity of Entenpfuhl. On 13 December, these regiments smashed into Simmerath, Witzerath, and Bikerath, Germany, and were fighting the Battle of Kesternich against the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division when General Gerd von Rundstedt launched his counteroffensive in the Monschau area. On December 15 the 2nd battalion, 309th Infantry was annihilated when the 272nd Volksgrenadiers counterattacked and took back Kesternich.

This situation was somewhat remedied on March 11, but the 13th and 48th were confined to reconnaissance activities. As the situation to the south deteriorated the STAVKA ordered a major regrouping of its forces. On March 12 Bryansk Front was disbanded and the 13th, 3rd, and 48th Armies were transferred to Army Gen. K. K. Rokossovskii's Central Front. German 2nd Army began a counteroffensive on March 14 against the overstretched 2nd Tank Army , while the STAVKA was removing part of Rokossovskii's forces to shore up the hard-pressed Voronezh Front. 13th Army remained stalled south of Trosna . In a flurry of orders a new Reserve Front, then a Kursk Front , and then an Oryol Front were all formed under Reyter's command, before Bryansk Front was reestablished on March 28. This command chaos brought any further Soviet offensive activity to a halt. In an after action report by Rokossovskii on March 18 General Mishchenko was singled out for criticism: 4.

In 1989, several members of the extinct Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's top police force, were arrested for their involvement in the murder of Buendía. The murder case was closed after the perpetrators were arrested, but several journalists doubt the probe's results and believe that the masterminds behind Buendía's murder were never arrested. Early life [ edit ] Manuel Buendía Tellezgirón was born in Zitácuaro, Michoacán , Mexico on 24 March 1926. He was the third child of José Buendía Gálvez (father) and Josefina Tellezgirón Tinoco (mother), both from the State of Mexico . Buendía attended a religious elementary school located in front of Teatro Juárez de Zitácuaro, a former theatre in his hometown. At the age of 12, his parents moved to Morelia, Michoacán and enrolled him at Seminario Menor, where he studied for three years. As a teenager, Buendía contributed to La Nación , a magazine of the National Action Party (PAN). Though he sympathized with the PAN during his early life, Buendía later lost interest in the party. His mother died of natural causes on 21 June 1941, and Buendía returned to Zitácuaro. After a few years, he was awarded a scholarship at Instituto Patria, a Jesuit high school in Mexico City. Upon graduation he attended the Escuela Libre de Derecho , a private Law school in Mexico City, but dropped out to take care of his family following the death of his father in 1945.",

Cosby's agents told the magazine he had earned at least $3 million in current advertising contracts – about one-fifth of his income – the rest of which he earned from live performances. Cosby returned as Coca-Cola's spokesperson in its 1982 \"Coke Is It\" campaign, a series of commercials mocking the Pepsi Challenge . One advertisement in this series showed a Pepsi vending machine to mock the brand, which author Mark Pendergrast called \"unthinkable\". Another said Pepsi Challenge commercials were misleading because they never showed anyone choosing Coke. John Bergin, who directed the series of commercials, personally disliked Cosby but said his presence in Coca-Cola advertising ended the first Pepsi Challenge campaign in 1983. Now see, if you were another cola, number 2 or number 29, you'd do taste tests and challenges and stuff and try to compare yourself to this, wouldn't you? Sure, don't shake your head, you would too, you sneaky devil. Cosby in a Coca-Cola ad, c. 1982. In mid-1982, Cosby was hired by Texas Instruments to appear in television advertisements for the company's TI-99/4A home computer. He was to be paid $1 million a year for the campaign. The company touted Cosby's education and rapport with adults and children. The campaign was aimed at parents, rather than children, as was the campaign for the Commodore 64 . Cosby was the face of a mystery rebate program, offering reimbursements of between $3 and $1,000; one Boston Globe writer dubbed it \"the Bill Cosby rebate model.\" J. Fred Bucy , who was head of Texas Instruments' home computer operation in 1983, scrapped Cosby's advertisements to focus on the product's educational value.",

          "text": "If a pattern can be identified this may inform procedures and legislation to reduce the risk of the same pattern of accident recurring in the future. An investigation may identify shortcomings in training or procedures, or problems with equipment. Fatalities are often investigated as potential crimes until the cause of death has been identified. Insurance claims may rely on information from an investigation to establish whether the accident is covered by a policy. Occupational health and safety inspectors may investigate an occupational diving incident to identify whether regulations have been violated. Civil litigation for claimed damages can be more equitably decided when the circumstances leading to the injury have been identified. The ability to provide documentary evidence showing that correct procedure was followed can simplify the investigation and may lead to more accurate and reliable findings. Equipment, procedures, organization, environment, individual factors and interactions between them are the sources of contributing and compounding events and conditions. Analysis of near accidents can be of great value to identify sources of error and allow planning to reduce or eliminate contributing and compounding conditions. A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident. Accident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal. Accidents continue to occur because the majority of the contributing and compounding factors are not addressed. Human behavior and the systems in which people work are too complex to analyse all possible interactions. A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur. The quality of diving accident investigation in the US is very variable between states.",

A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident. The fatality is the peak of the accident pyramid. The base of the pyramid is the shortcuts, and in between are escalating levels of near-accidents which could (but too often do not) serve as lessons learned. Blumenberg, 1996. Accident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal.

A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur. Crisis management [ edit ] Accidents frequently appear to happen unexpectedly because people failed to recognize the indications of developing crisis which resulted in the accident. A crisis can be defined as a rapidly developing sequence of events in which the risks associated with the system rapidly increase to a hazardous state. The interaction of system factors is complex and often unpredictable, and hazard can accumulate at a rate which varies depending on the system, until corrective action is taken, the hazard dissipates without intervention, or an accident occurs. Although the individual operator is most often responsible for committing errors that cause accidents, it is also often the individual operator who is best placed to recognize the development of a dangerous situation and take corrective action, and this usually happens before the situation escalates into an accident.",

          "text": "A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career. These findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgment or performance, and may result in an accident. Human error and panic are considered to be the leading causes of dive accidents and fatalities. Only 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause. The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to these factors. The study also concluded that it would be impossible to eliminate absolutely all minor contraindications for scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and would bring all diving to a halt. Human factors engineering (HFE), also known as human factors and ergonomics , is the application of psychological and physiological principles to the engineering and design of equipment, procedures, processes, and systems. Primary goals of human factors engineering are to reduce human error , increase productivity and system availability, and enhance safety, health and comfort with a specific focus on the interaction between the human and equipment. Factors influencing the performance of a diving team [ edit ] A diving team may be considered as a system which is influenced by equipment, environment, procedures, organisation, individuals, and interactions. There are considerations associated with each of these factors relating specifically to diving. The diving environment and equipment are external influences with which the diver interacts, and their effects are partly independent of human factors, but procedures, organisation and individuals are primarily human factors.",

In some Russian, Canadian and European music conservatoires , free bass accordion is considered a serious instrument for study and there is now a large modern repertoire for it. Free bass accordion is taught at the undergraduate and post-graduate levels at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City. In the United States, free bass instruments are much less well known despite attempts to popularize them by Palmer and Hughes and the Giulietti Accordion Company in the 1960s and 1970s. In Canada, the accordionist Joseph Macerollo even collaborated on the development of a detailed syllabus for students of the Free-bass accordion while on the faculty of the Royal Conservatory of Music Toronto (RCMT) in the mid 20th century. During this period several American accordionists demonstrated the unique orchestral sound of the instrument through live performances as well as by composing original works which featured the instrument. Included among this group was John Serry, Sr. whose Concerto for Free Bass Accordion was completed during the 1960s.

It is the earliest known electric-powered musical instrument, antedated only by the Denis d'or , which is only known from written accounts. The world's first electronic instrument was created in 1753 by the Czech musician and clergyman Prokop Divish (1698 - 1765). His distinctive feature was to show experiments in physics lessons. Among other things, Divish became famous for his original musical instrument, called \"denidor\". The very first writing about this instrument dates back to February 27, 1753 and is contained in a letter from the evangelical theologian Friedrich Christoph Oetinger . It is a response to an unknown letter from Divish to the priest from the Württemberg city of Weinsberg. Therefore, work on the instrument was completed in early 1753. Later, Delaborde described the instrument in his 1761 publication, Le clavessin électrique . The mechanism was based on a contemporary warning-bell device, and the instrument was essentially an electric carillon . A number of bells, two for each pitch, hang from iron bars along with their clappers (one for each pair). A globe generator charged the prime conductor and the iron bars. The musician pressed a key and one of the bells of the corresponding pair was grounded, cut off from the charge source. The clapper then oscillated between the grounded and the charged bells, producing the desired tone. The somewhat inappropriate choice of the instrument's name was defended by Delaborde, who claimed that it was far superior to a carillon.",

Regardless of their ambiguous evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system , with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus has yet to be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes. Plants [ edit ] In addition to humans and flies, some plants also make use of the XX/XY dosage compensation systems. Silene latifolia plants are also either male (XY) or female (XX), with the Y chromosome being smaller, with fewer genes expressed, than the X chromosome. Two separate studies have shown male S.",

          "text": "Z-specific genes were over-expressed in males when compared to females, and a few genes had equal expression in both male and female Z chromosomes. In chickens, most of the dosage compensated genes exist on the Zp, or short, arm of the chromosome while the non-compensated genes are on the Zq, or long, arm of the chromosome. The compensated (silenced) genes on Zp resemble a region on the primitive platypus sex chromosome, suggesting an ancestor to the XX/XY system. Birds [ edit ] The sex chromosomes of birds evolved separately from those of mammals and share very little sequence homology with the XY chromosomes. As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two hermaphrodite X chromosomes of C. elegans . However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as \"less effective\" at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans.",

          "text": "Biological process Dosage compensation is the process by which organisms equalize the expression of genes between members of different biological sexes. Across species, different sexes are often characterized by different types and numbers of sex chromosomes . In order to neutralize the large difference in gene dosage produced by differing numbers of sex chromosomes among the sexes, various evolutionary branches have acquired various methods to equalize gene expression among the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of genes , different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to cope with this inequality. Replicating the actual gene is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the expression from each gene. For example, in humans , female (XX) cells randomly silence the transcription of one X chromosome , and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes per cell as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes. Different lineages have evolved different mechanisms to cope with the differences in gene copy numbers between the sexes that are observed on sex chromosomes. Some lineages have evolved dosage compensation, an epigenetic mechanism which restores expression of X or Z specific genes in the heterogametic sex to the same levels observed in the ancestor prior to the evolution of the sex chromosome. Other lineages equalize the expression of the X- or Z- specific genes between the sexes, but not to the ancestral levels, i.e. they possess incomplete compensation with \"dosage balance\". One example of this is X-inactivation which occurs in humans. The third documented type of gene dose regulatory mechanism is incomplete compensation without balance (sometimes referred to as incomplete or partial dosage compensation). In this system gene expression of sex-specific loci is reduced in the heterogametic sex i.e. the females in ZZ/ZW systems and males in XX/XY systems.",

Myoblast migration is preceded by the formation of connective tissue frameworks, usually formed from the somatic lateral plate mesoderm . Myoblasts follow chemical signals to the appropriate locations, where they fuse into elongate skeletal muscle cells. Function [ edit ] Further information: Sliding filament theory The primary function of muscle tissue is contraction . The three types of muscle tissue (skeletal, cardiac and smooth) have significant differences. However, all three use the movement of actin against myosin to create contraction. Skeletal muscle [ edit ] In skeletal muscle, contraction is stimulated by electrical impulses transmitted by the motor nerves . Cardiac and smooth muscle contractions are stimulated by internal pacemaker cells which regularly contract, and propagate contractions to other muscle cells they are in contact with. All skeletal muscle and many smooth muscle contractions are facilitated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine . Smooth muscle [ edit ] Smooth muscle is found in almost all organ systems such as hollow organs including the stomach , and bladder ; in tubular structures such as blood and lymph vessels , and bile ducts ; in sphincters such as in the uterus, and the eye. In addition, it plays an important role in the ducts of exocrine glands. It fulfills various tasks such as sealing orifices (e.g. pylorus, uterine os) or the transport of the chyme through wavelike contractions of the intestinal tube. Smooth muscle cells contract more slowly than skeletal muscle cells, but they are stronger, more sustained and require less energy. Smooth muscle is also involuntary, unlike skeletal muscle, which requires a stimulus. Cardiac muscle [ edit ] Cardiac muscle is the muscle of the heart.",

On the week of August 4, 2001, the song jumped from number 60 to number two on the chart, as a result of Carey's publicized hospitalization, as well as Virgin's price reduction on the single, becoming the largest jump into the top-three spot in Billboard history; this record was later broke by American singer JoJo for her song \" Too Little Too Late \" (2006). Its poor radio airplay throughout the United States was given as the reason as to why it did not reach number one.",

During the interrogation of the chief rabbi, Wilkinson asked, referring to the qadi's decision to dismiss the case: \"What signifies the Mollah's judgment to us after what happened in Damascus and it is proved that, according to the Talmud , Christian blood must be used in making your Passover bread?\" The consuls were also present during much of the torture. When the chief rabbi, an Austrian subject, was tortured, he appealed to Austrian vice-consul Anton Giuliani, who replied: \"What rabbi? What do you complain about? So you are not dead yet.\" Some Jewish inhabitants of Rhodes accused the consuls of a conspiracy to exploit the case to eliminate Elias Kalimati, a local Jew, who represented the business interests of Joel Davis, a Jewish businessman from London. Davis was rapidly increasing his share in the profitable sponge exports from the island, and he was a major business rival of the European consuls. Kalimati, however, was not among the persons held in the affair, calling that allegation into question. Other Jewish sources claimed that the \"consuls stated openly… their purpose of exterminating the Jews of Rhodes or to compel them to change their religion.\" European diplomatic involvement [ edit ] Map of southeastern Europe and the Levant , showing the extent of the Ottoman Empire in 1840 (red outline).

Integration and nationalism [ edit ] Bicolor version of the Romani flag , reportedly used by the UGRR One of the key goals of the UGRR was in convincing members and outsiders to use romi (\"Romanies\") over țigani , which it viewed as derogatory. News reports of the 1933 congress and its aftermath used the term, but often in quotation marks, indicating that it \"was not fully accepted by the Romanian public opinion.\" Lăzurică himself extended the neologism to mean \"freedom-loving man\", rather than simply \"man\", and claimed that it had etymological links to Ramayana . As argued by Matei, he had had no objection to using țigani as an endonym during his association with Șerboianu, and had left several written statements describing himself as a \"Gypsy\". Matei notes that the newer term was most likely suggested to him by Nicolae Constantin Batzaria , the Romanian head editor at Adevărul . In his column of September 5, 1933, Batzaria had chided Șerboianu for using an implicitly demeaning and hostile term, arguing for romi as both authentic and preferable. Lăzurică's first documented use of romi is dated by Matei to October 1933, in a manifesto which repeats Batzaria's attack on Șerboianu. His newfound appreciation for the term was challenged by the more senior activist Naftanailă, who, by 1934, had reconciled with the word țigani and was using it in the title of his rival newspaper, Neamul Țigănesc .",

Reception [ edit ] Critical reaction to the album was mixed. Billboard reviewed the album in the 24 April 1976 edition of the publication and called it \"a worthy blend of European rock and symphonic sounds.\" They believed that side one of the LP possessed the superior material with their \"catchy hooks\" and that Arthur Brown provided the best vocal performance on the album. Record World referred to the album as an \"elaborate package\" that was \"a considerable accomplishment for Parsons, Eric Woolfson and Andrew Powell.\" Rolling Stone 's Billy Altman concluded it did not completely accurately reproduce Poe's tension and macabre fear, ending by saying \"devotees of Gothic literature will have to wait for someone with more of the macabre in their blood for a truer musical reading of Poe's often terrifying works.\" Nonetheless, the album has still garnered somewhat of a cult status amongst Alan Parsons Project fans. In July 2010, the album was named as one of Classic Rock magazine 's \"50 Albums That Built Prog Rock\". Reissues [ edit ] Originally simply called The Alan Parsons Project , the album was successful enough to achieve gold status. The identity of The Alan Parsons Project as a group was cemented on the second album, I Robot , in 1977. In 1987, Parsons completely remixed the album, including additional keyboard and guitar passages and narration (by Orson Welles ), as well as updating the production style to include heavy reverb and the gated reverb snare drum sound, which was popular in the 1980s. Parsons also made the end of side A segue into the start of side B due to the remix of the album being released when CD's were commercially available, thus no need to stop playback to change sides.",

          "text": "Z-specific genes were over-expressed in males when compared to females, and a few genes had equal expression in both male and female Z chromosomes. In chickens, most of the dosage compensated genes exist on the Zp, or short, arm of the chromosome while the non-compensated genes are on the Zq, or long, arm of the chromosome. The compensated (silenced) genes on Zp resemble a region on the primitive platypus sex chromosome, suggesting an ancestor to the XX/XY system. Birds [ edit ] The sex chromosomes of birds evolved separately from those of mammals and share very little sequence homology with the XY chromosomes. As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two hermaphrodite X chromosomes of C. elegans . However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as \"less effective\" at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans.",

Thus, the function of the selective silencing may be to spare dosage compensation of genes crucial for sex determination of homologous pairing. Recent studies are focusing on how epigenetic mechanisms could contribute to dosage compensation in birds, with a particular emphasis on methylation . It is already known that some regions on the Z chromosome of birds are heavily methylated, called MHM regions. So far, only two such regions have been well studied: one located at around 27.3 Mb and the other at 73.16–73.17 Mb (designated MHM2). The first MHM region discovered consists of tandem repeats of a BamHI 2.2-kb sequence and has a high degree of methylation on the cytosine of CpG islands (segments of cytosine-phosphate-guanine that are more readily methylated and silenced than other DNA segments) in both copies of the Z chromosome in males, and less so in the Z chromosome of females. This region is transcribed only in females and produces a long non-coding RNA, which gathers at the transcription site next to the DMRT1 gene. The second MHM region, at 73.16 Mb, is not as extensively studied due to its recent discovery. It appears to be smaller in size and contains three long non-coding RNA sequences with higher expression in females. Findings also suggest that the mechanism is more gene-specific, as certain genetic variants, called methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), can affect methylation. These meQTLs are hypothesized to impact a larger part of the Z chromosome in males and are mostly located on autosomes, affecting the Z chromosome in a trans manner.",

These nests are constructed out of mud and are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces, typically in caves or on cliffs. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide exists in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month. This species is classified as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction . A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl is considered one of Africa's most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range. Taxonomy [ edit ] This species was first described by Anton Reichenow in 1899 from a bird collected at the base of Mount Cameroon near Limbe, Cameroon . He published his description in Ornithologische Monatsberichte and described it as Picathartes oreas . The generic name was first used by René-Primevère Lesson in 1828 after he split the grey-necked rockfowl's close relative the white-necked rockfowl from the crow genus Corvus and placed it in its own genus, Picathartes , as the white-necked rockfowl did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head. This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for \"magpie\" and cathartes for \"vulture\". The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek word oreas , meaning \"mountain\".",

It is either built onto the rock surface or, in some cases, is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure. Nests are built at least away 1 metre (3.3 ft) from each other, and in some cases up to 5 metres (16 ft). The nest is normally 30 to 40 centimetres (12 to 16 in) thick, though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was 140 centimetres (55 in) thick. It is about 290 centimetres (110 in) wide and 400 centimetres (160 in) long and weighs about 3 kilograms (6.6 lb). However, nest sizes do have a large degree of variability. After the mud dries, it becomes a very hard structure. The inside of the nest is lined with rootlets and thin strips of grass. One to three eggs, normally two, are laid, with the second egg being laid between 24 and 48 hours after the first. The eggs are variable in coloration and can be a light yellow-brown with dark brown blotches, creamy white with dark brown or grey blotches, or pale grey with brown mottling. The eggs weigh about 15.2 grams (0.54 oz) and have an average size of 40.5 millimetres (1.59 in) by 27.5 millimetres (1.08 in). The rockfowl begins to incubate after both eggs are laid. The time the rockfowl spends incubating varies greatly, though it is mostly for less than five minutes at a time with nearly two hours between sessions. Both the male and female rockfowl incubate.",

Game structure [ edit ] The object of the game is to score more runs (points) than the other team by batting (hitting) a ball into play and running around the bases, touching each one in succession. The ball is a sphere of light material, covered with leather or synthetic material. It is 11 to 12 inches (28–30 cm) (or, rarely, 16 in or 41 cm ) in circumference. The game is officiated by one or more neutral umpires . Players and umpires are generally free to ask for a brief stoppage at any time when the ball is not in play (called a time out), or immediately following a play once its outcome is clear. The game is played in usually seven innings . Each inning is divided into a top half , in which the away team bats and tries to score runs, while the home team occupies the field and tries to record three outs ; then a bottom half , when the teams' roles are reversed. Some leagues play with a reduced number of innings or with a time limit, rather than the traditional seven innings. Batting and pitching [ edit ] The strike zone hovers above home plate, varying in dimensions based on the batter's height. To start play, the offense sends a batter to home plate . The batting order must be fixed at the start of the game, and players may not bat out of turn. The defense's pitcher stands atop the rubber and pitches the ball towards home plate using an underhand motion. In fast pitch, the pitcher is allowed to take one step back prior to releasing the ball during the forward movement. The batter attempts to hit the pitched ball with a bat , a long, round, smooth stick made of wood , metal or composite .",

Third base is also called the \"Hot Corner\" because the ball can pop off the bat at the fielder very fast. Third baseman must have great reflexes and be very quick on their feet because not only to they need to be quick to field a bunt but also if they are unable to predict whether the batter will bunt or hit, a ball that is hit may be a line drive to the face. It also helps if they can run fast but it is not a requirement. A third baseman must have a very strong arm so that they can throw a runner out from across the diamond. Any ball that the third baseman can get, they should. They will have more momentum towards first base when fielding the ball than a shortstop. They are also closer to first base when they cut off a slower ground ball towards shortstop. Third baseman are responsible for covering third base at all times unless the ball is hit to them. In that instance, the shortstop is responsible for third base. Third baseman must be smart, have great reflexes, have a strong accurate arm, and be quick with their hands. Outfielders [ edit ] The outfielders are players that cover the grassy area behind the infield. Outfielders are named for their positions in the field relative to home plate. Traditional outfield positions include a left fielder, a center fielder, and a right fielder. Each player has a specific job as being an outfielder. Right fielder [ edit ] The right fielder's position is on the right side of the field, in the opening between the first and second basemen, when looking at the field from behind home plate. The right fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the outfield. The right fielder has a multitude of jobs over the course of a softball game.",

Despite years of public and private attempts to spur economic growth, urban decay and high poverty have long been widespread in this area, with many residents still living in former cigar workers' homes built almost a century ago. From 2000 to 2009, gentrification and redevelopment slowly began to spread to the current V.M. Ybor neighborhood located north and west of the Ybor City Historic District. During the period, the poverty rate in this area dropped from over 40% to about 13%. Most Tampa cigar factories were made of wood and by 2018, only two such structures remained: the Oliva factory, totally renovated and converted into apartments, and the Salvador Rodriguez Co. on 22nd St. S. in the Palmetto Beach area, now an office building.

Listed building consent must be obtained from local authorities prior to any alteration to such a structure. There are approximately 8,500 listed buildings in Northern Ireland, representing 2% of the total building stock. Of these, around 580 are listed at Grade B+. County Londonderry covers 2,074 square kilometres (801 sq mi), and has a population of around 233,500. The County has 65 Grade B+ listed buildings. Listed buildings [ edit ] Notes [ edit ] ^ Sometimes known as OSGB36, the grid reference is based on the British national grid reference system used by the Ordnance Survey . ^ The type of structure, as identified by the DfC. ^ The \"HB Number\" is a unique number assigned to each listed building by the DfC.

By the late 1980s, Rodgers was finding it increasingly difficult to remain profitable in the face of competition from larger, national chains, and even variety store chains with nationwide coverage, such as Woolworth's and Newberry's , were succumbing to competition from chains featuring larger stores, such as Wal-Mart and Target . The company closed its Hollywood store and sold the building in 1984. Rodgers' Cedar Mill store closed in 1988, the space being taken over by an expanded Cedar Mill Library. The last three stores in the chain, in Portland's Menlo Park Shopping Center (at NE 122nd & Glisan), in the Westmoreland neighborhood, and in Lake Oswego, closed in early 1998.

St Paul’s Church, on Saunder Bank, was founded in 1845 and closed in 1961. It did not have a graveyard. In 1848 the Sunday School started, and the 1851 census showed there was a school room licensed for worship prior to the erection of church. The church proper was built in 1853. When the church closed in 1961, the parish combined with St Catherine. In 1963 the church was demolished. Holy Trinity Church , Accrington Road, Habergham Eaves (The Mitre), was founded in 1835 on land given by Robert Townley Parker. It was consecrated in 1836. In 1873 a chancel was added. In 1989 the church closed and the site converted into flats, with the parish combining with St Matthew's. St Saviour’s Church, in Church Street, closed in 1954. It had begun in 1893 as a Protestant Association Mission Room in Chaffer's Yard. It then moved to a room above Carter's Surgery in Church Street. In 1898 a Gospel Protestant Mission Hall in Church Street was also formed, by a group from St Peter's Church, following a disagreement. In the 1800s St Ayden Mission, for Holy Trinity, existed in Canal Street, Habergham Eaves, and later in Charlotte Street, Habergham Eaves.",

The vast majority of the area was destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 but rebuilt quickly. In 1885 the Home Insurance Building , generally considered the world's first skyscraper, was constructed, followed by the development of the Chicago school , best exemplified by such buildings as the Rookery Building in 1888, the Monadnock Building in 1891, and the Sullivan Center in 1899. Loop architecture has been dominated by skyscrapers and high-rises since early in its history. Notable buildings include the Home Insurance Building , considered the world's first skyscraper (demolished in 1931); the Chicago Board of Trade Building , a National Historic Landmark ; and Willis Tower , the world's tallest building for nearly 25 years. Some of the historic buildings in this district were instrumental in the development of towers. This area abounds in shopping opportunities, including the Loop Retail Historic District , although it competes with the more upscale Magnificent Mile area to the north. It includes Chicago's former Marshall Field's department store location in the Marshall Field and Company Building ; the original Sullivan Center Carson Pirie Scott store location (closed February 21, 2007). Chicago's Downtown Theatre District is also found within this area, along with numerous restaurants and hotels. Chicago Loop from the air in 2025.

The 28th Division—just like the 9th before it (and the 4th Infantry Division, which would relieve the 28th)—also took heavy casualties during its stay in the Hürtgen Forest. On 14 November, the 2nd Ranger Battalion arrived to relieve elements of the 112th Infantry Regiment. On 6 December, the Rangers moved on Bergstein and subsequently took the strategic position of Hill 400 from defending troops from 980th Grenadier Regiment of the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division . Shortly thereafter, on 12 December, the towns of Gey and Strass were taken by American Forces. On the last day of the Hürtgen battle the Germans retook the hill from the 13th Regiment who had replaced the Rangers. The U.S. Army would not seize Hill 400 again until February 1945. From 1–12 December, the 309th, 310th and 311th Infantry Regiments of the 78th Infantry Division (\"Lightning\") relieved elements of the 1st Infantry Division in the line in the vicinity of Entenpfuhl. On 13 December, these regiments smashed into Simmerath, Witzerath, and Bikerath, Germany, and were fighting the Battle of Kesternich against the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division when General Gerd von Rundstedt launched his counteroffensive in the Monschau area. On December 15 the 2nd battalion, 309th Infantry was annihilated when the 272nd Volksgrenadiers counterattacked and took back Kesternich.

In the first phase, the Soviet Union occupied the Republic of Estonia and dissolved the parliament ( Riigikogu ), then in its sixth legislature, on 5 July 1940. A new Stalinist \"people's parliament\" was \"elected\" on 14 and 15 July (with only members of the Soviet-backed Estonian Working People's Union allowed to stand for election), and the newly formed chamber announced the establishment of the \"Estonian SSR\" on 21 July and the self-proclaimed state was annexed by the Soviet Union on 6 August 1940. The chamber was officially called the Riigivolikogu (State Council) from inception until 25 August 1940 when it was designated the ENSV Ajutine Ülemnõukogu (Provisional Supreme Soviet of the ESSR) and then on 7 April 1941 was formally styled the ENSV Ülemnõukogu (Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR). Between July 1941 and 1944, Estonia was occupied by Germany. When the Soviet Union regained power in 1944, it continued the legislative session of the Supreme Soviet and extended it until the session's end on 16 February 1947. Elections for the second Supreme Soviet followed.

Planetary moons other than Earth's were never given symbols in the astronomical literature. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer who designed most of the dwarf planet symbols, proposed a Greek iota (the initial of Io) combined with the cross-bar of the Jupiter symbol as the symbol of Io ( ). This symbol is not widely used. Observational history [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Io Io as part of the Medician stars , for the first time reported and drawn in the Sidereus Nuncius (the 'starry messenger'), 1610. The moons are drawn in changing positions. The first reported observation of Io was made by Galileo Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20x-power, refracting telescope at the University of Padua . However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low power of his telescope, so the two were recorded as a single point of light. Io and Europa were seen for the first time as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jovian system the following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Io by the IAU ). The discovery of Io and the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter was published in Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610. In his Mundus Jovialis , published in 1614, Simon Marius claimed to have discovered Io and the other moons of Jupiter in 1609, one week before Galileo's discovery.",

          "text": "Reactions to and condemnation of the bombing of Guernica is regarded by some historians as a turning point in the construction of the modern concept of human rights . Picasso's painting [ edit ] Mural in Guernica based on the Picasso painting . Basque nationalists advocate that the painting be brought to the town, as can be seen in the slogan underneath. Main article: Guernica (Picasso) Guernica quickly became a world-renowned symbol of civilian suffering resulting from conflict and inspired Pablo Picasso to adapt one of his existing commissions into Guernica . The Spanish Republican Government had commissioned a work from him for the Spanish pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. Though he accepted the invitation to display a piece, he remained uninspired until he heard of the bombing of Guernica. Before the bombing of Guernica took place, Picasso never cared much for anything to do with politics. Once Picasso heard the news he changed his commissioned work for Spain into a reflection on the massacre. Picasso began the painting on 11 May 1937, working on a piece of unbleached muslin (349 cm x 776 cm). Since the work was so large, Picasso had to use a ladder and a long-handled brush to reach the furthest corners of the canvas. He spent over two months creating Guernica . He used only black and white paint to invoke the truth-telling authority of documentary photography. \"The protest is found in what has happened to the bodies, the hands, the soles of the feet, the horse's tongue, the mother's breasts, the eyes in the head—the imaginative equivalent of what happened to them in the flesh. We are made to feel their pain with our own eyes.\" The display of Picasso's work at (Republican) Spain's Pavilion during the 1937 World's Fair in Paris reflected the effect on public consciousness.",

          "text": "List of places of worship St Peter's Church, Church Street Burnley , in Lancashire , England, has a long history of religious worship , dating from at least before 1122 in the case of the St Peter's Church . The chapel at Towneley Hall was the centre for Roman Catholic worship in Burnley until modern times. Well before the Industrial Revolution , the town saw the emergence of many non-conformist churches and chapels. In 1891 the town was the location of the meeting which saw the creation of the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland . In the late 19th century a Jewish synagogue was established, and in recent times evangelical and free churches have appeared, as well as a large purpose-built mosque . The 2001 census for Burnley gives a religious make-up of 74.5% Christian , 6.6% Muslim , 0.3% Hindu and 11.0% \"No religion\". Records are held for at least 77 places of Christian worship in Burnley. These include churches of the following denominations : fourteen Anglican, seven Baptist, five Congregational (now United Reformed Church ), one Independent , one Independent Methodist , one Jehovah's Witness , twenty-five Methodist , one the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), one New Jerusalem , four Particular Baptist , seven Roman Catholic, one Scottish Baptist , one Spiritualist , one Unitarian , seven United Methodist Free Church . The largest place of worship in Burnley is at Life Church Lancashire, on Sycamore Avenue (formerly the Gannow Baths). Life Church completed their new building, with a 500-seater auditorium, in November 2014. The town has a total of 17 religious building or structures which are designated as listed buildings – all Grade II by English Heritage .",

Once at the summit, the young victims would then be administered an intoxicating drink or other substance to either induce sleep or a stupor , ostensibly to let the final ritual go on smoothly. If the ceremony was carried out in a particularly cold place, they could die from hypothermia. In other cases, death was caused in a more violent manner. This was the case of the Aconcagua child, with a strong blow to the head, as well as that of the girl at Sara Sara and the young woman from the snowy Ampato, while the cause of death of the \"Queen of the Hill\" was a puncture wound in the right hemithorax, which entered through her back. While in some cases, as in Llullaillaco, the bodies were deposited in a burial chamber and covered with gravel, or, in the case of Cerro El Plomo, the sacrificial victim was wrapped in a complex funerary bundle of several pieces with a specific function and message, as in the case of Aconcagua. When the sacrifices of children and material offerings were buried, the holes could not be made using any metal, but dug out using sharpened sticks during the ceremony. Once dead, the children would then be buried in a fetal position, wrapped up in a bundle with various artifacts within the bundle or next to it in the same grave. Non-human sacrifice and offerings [ edit ] A number of offerings were often left with the sacrificed individuals at the sites of capacocha ceremonies. The human body itself was often finely dressed and clothed in a feathered headdress and other ornamentation such as a necklace or bracelet. The most elaborate artifacts were typically paired human statuettes and llama figurines that have been crafted with gold, silver, and spondylus shells .",

          "text": "Phrase about Jeffrey Epstein's death Graffiti featuring the phrase on an overpass on Interstate 71 in Cincinnati \" Epstein didn't kill himself \" (\" EDKH \") is a phrase used to reject the official cause of the death of American financier and child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . Authorities concluded that he died of suicide by hanging in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City in August 2019. Epstein was a convicted sex offender with connections to and public interactions with many powerful and wealthy people. His incarceration led to public hope that he might reveal the identities of other sex offenders, especially those in positions of authority and influence. When his suicide was reported, numerous hypotheses and conspiracy theories emerged to speculate about the true nature and cause of his death, framing the official suicide narrative as a lie, typically labelling it as part of a cover-up . The phrase became a colloquialism as well as an internet meme , gaining traction in November 2019 as more of the details surrounding his death became public. \"Epstein didn't kill himself\" is used by and draws a wide audience, many of whom disagree with each other on the true circumstances surrounding Epstein's death. Generally, however, these theories agree that the true cause of his death was homicide , especially by strangulation , and that it was ordered by those who had engaged in sex offenses with Epstein, so that they could avoid the truth becoming public. Oftentimes these theories will assert the existence of an Epstein client list , or \"black book\" in which the names of high-profile sex criminals were recorded so that Epstein could blackmail them, should the need arise. Donald Trump pictured in 2000 with president of the United States Bill Clinton , Melania Trump (rightmost), and Kylie Bax (leftmost) The accusations of murder associated with \"Epstein didn't kill himself\" are typically levied against people who the speaker dislikes or disagrees with politically.",

It just doesn't make sense that the highest-profile prisoner in America—you know, someone forgot to guard him.\" Former US Attorney and Senate Judiciary Committee counsel Brett Tolman said the death was \"more than coincidental\" considering Epstein's \"many connections to powerful people\".

After being told that he could, he stated, \"If you see the coverage [about combat dogs] and you decide I want one of these dogs, either buy a fully trained and finished dog from a professional or just don't get one at all. That, and Epstein didn't kill himself.\" Ritland later stated his purpose for suddenly mentioning the phrase was to keep the Jeffrey Epstein story alive. According to The Washington Post , the meme gained a large amount of attention in the immediate aftermath of this interview. Arizona Republican Congressman Paul Gosar shared the phrase in a series of 23 tweets where the first letter of each tweet spelled out the phrase.",

The following week, reigning champion Will Ospreay lost the title to MJF , who unofficially rebranded the title as the American Championship. Ospreay then regained the title at All In, restoring it as the International Championship and subsequently confirming that Ospreay would be the defending champion against Pac at All Out. In late 2023, Willow Nightingale formed a tag team with Kris Statlander and they were managed by Stokely Hathaway . On May 26 at Double or Nothing , Statlander attacked Nightingale after the latter lost her match, thus ending their team with Hathaway siding with Statlander. They would continue to feud throughout the summer and during the All In Zero Hour pre-show on August 25, the team of Nightingale and Tomohiro Ishii defeated the team of Statlander and Hathaway in a mixed tag team match , thus allowing Nightingale and Ishii to choose the stipulation of a match between Nightingale and Statlander at All Out. They subsequently chose a Chicago Street Fight . The feud between \"Hangman\" Adam Page and Swerve Strickland dates back to WrestleDream in October 2023. The two had faced each other at the event, which Strickland won. It became personal after Strickland broke into Page's house, including going into his sleeping kid's room. A rematch occurred at Full Gear in November as a Texas Death match , which Strickland also won. Both were then in a three-way match for the AEW World Championship at Revolution in March 2024, where Samoa Joe retained by submitting Page. Page subsequently disappeared from television while Strickland won the championship from Joe at Dynasty in April.",

Márquez dominated proceedings in Argentina from start to finish, claiming pole, the fastest lap, and cruising to victory by almost ten seconds. He set pole in the United States for a seventh consecutive season, but surprisingly crashed out of the lead, ruining his perfect record at that circuit. Honda attributed this to a problem with the new engine brake in low-speed corners. Márquez avenged the crash by reclaiming the title lead with a composed win at Jerez , where he once again led from start to finish. He took a third victory in France , where he pulled into the lead after an early fight with Jack Miller . Márquez had to settle for second at Mugello , after a three-man battle with Ducati duo Dovizioso and race-winner Danilo Petrucci . In Catalonia , Márquez was threatened early on in the race by strong starts from several of his rivals. However, his new teammate Lorenzo lost the front end of his bike on the second lap, triggering a collision which eliminated Lorenzo, Dovizioso, Viñales and Rossi from the race. Márquez narrowly escaped the pile-up and breezed across the line unchallenged. In Assen , Márquez increased his title lead by finishing second to Viñales, who was 100 points adrift in the title standings. The other championship contenders all had a difficult race. Márquez unsurprisingly dominated at the Sachsenring , where he set pole, the fastest lap, and won his tenth consecutive race. Returning from summer break, Márquez set an extraordinary pole position at Brno . Qualifying was run in changeable conditions, but the circuit was dry enough to go out on slick tyres.",

For some time she lived with her mother in Warsaw . In 1819 she published her first book, Pamiątka po dobrej matce, czyli ostatnie jej rady dla córki ( A Souvenir After a Good Mother, or Her Final Advice to Her Daughter ), a monologue in which an older woman imparts final words of wisdom and advice to a daughter. In 1829 she married Karol Boromeusz Hoffman , writer, lawyer and historian, and changed her name to Hoffmanowa, a marital form of her husband's surname. After Poland's November Uprising against the Russian Empire was crushed in the second half of 1831, Hoffmanowa moved with her husband to Dresden , and later settled in Paris . She was called \"the Mother of the Great Emigration ”. In 1919 a Warsaw high school, one of the oldest in the country, was named after her.

          "text": "This was León's first major translation of a biblical text and was probably inspired by a commentary his contemporary Arias Montano had lent to him when he passed through Salamanca in 1561. Translation of biblical texts into Spanish had been banned by the Council of Trent, so there was a certain risk in this undertaking. The manuscript, however, was popular amongst his friends, who copied it and circulated it privately. However, the translations formed part of the accusations levelled against León when he was denounced to the Inquisition in 1572. Because of the controversial nature of the text, it was not published until 1798. In Cantica Canticorum Salomonis explanatio ( Commentary on the Song of Solomon ) [ edit ] This was published in 1580 and built on an earlier Spanish commentary. He revised and enlarged it in a 1589 edition. La Perfecta Casada ( The Perfect Wife ) [ edit ] This book is Fray Luis’s interpretation of the Proverbs of Solomon, and was written as a moral exposition to his newly married young niece. It advises all young women on the proper behaviour and duties of a married woman, both in regard to her husband and her children. The book quickly became a popular wedding gift to young women of the era, as it was an instruction manual for marriage. In addition, this book was a revolutionary defence of women’s roles in society at the time. It was first published in 1583 and was popular, appearing in six editions by 1632. De los Nombres de Cristo ( The Names of Christ ) [ edit ] Another well-known work, this was written as a guide to the layman about the essential principles of the church. It is written in dialogue form about three friends who discuss fourteen of the Scriptural names of Christ over a period of two days in a country estate. Each book ends in a lyrical meditation expressed in a poem.",

In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the U.S. in 1850. In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch , an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century. Obama has described the ancestors of his grandparents as Scotch-Irish mostly. Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo . His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent. Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa , where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii , on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born. In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle , where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University , where he earned a Master of Arts in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964. Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the Ministry of Finance. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.",

Australia entered World War II on 3 September 1939, following the government's acceptance of the United Kingdom 's declaration of war on Nazi Germany . Australia later entered into a state of war with other members of the Axis powers , including the Kingdom of Italy on 11 June 1940, and the Empire of Japan on 9 December 1941. By the end of the war almost one million Australians had served in the armed forces , whose military units fought primarily in the European theatre , North African campaign , and the South West Pacific theatre . In addition, Australia came under direct attack for the first time in its post-colonial history. Its casualties from enemy action during the war were 27,073 killed and 23,477 wounded. Many more suffered from tropical disease , hunger, and harsh conditions in captivity; of the 21,467 Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese, only 14,000 survived. Australian Army units were gradually withdrawn from the Mediterranean and Europe following the outbreak of war with Japan. However, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy units and personnel continued to take part in the war against Germany and Italy. From 1942 until early 1944, Australian forces played a key role in the Pacific War , making up the majority of Allied strength throughout much of the fighting in the South West Pacific theatre . While the military was largely relegated to subsidiary fronts from mid-1944, it continued offensive operations against the Japanese until the war ended. World War II contributed to major changes in the nation's economy, military and foreign policy. The war accelerated the process of industrialisation, led to the development of a larger peacetime military and began the process with which Australia shifted the focus of its foreign policy from Britain to the United States .",

In addition, a Japanese carrier raid on Pearl Harbor had devastated the American battle fleet in December 1941. Raeder, anxious to secure air protection for the Kriegsmarine ' s heavier surface units, informed Hitler that Graf Zeppelin could be finished in about a year, with another six months required for sea trials and flight training. On 13 May 1942, with Hitler's authorization, the German Naval Supreme Command ordered work resumed on the carrier. But daunting technical problems remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, specifically designed for carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe , replied that the already overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types could be developed. Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume. The converted carrier aircraft were heavier versions of their land-based predecessors and this required a host of changes to Graf Zeppelin ' s original design: the existing catapults needed modernization; stronger winches were necessary for the arresting gear; the flight deck, elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement.",

          "text": "Instead, in March 1942, the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa and New Caledonia . This plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway . While these battles ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943. MacArthur with Blamey and Prime Minister Curtin in March 1942 The collapse of British power in the Pacific also led Australia to reorient its foreign and military policy towards the United States. Curtin stated in December 1941 \"that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom.\" In February 1942 the US and British Governments agreed that Australia would become a strategic responsibility of the United States and the Allied ANZAC Force was created specifically to defend the Australian continent. In March, General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Australia after escaping from the Philippines and assumed command of the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). All of the Australian military's combat units in this area were placed under MacArthur's command, and MacArthur replaced the Australian Chiefs of Staff as the Australian Government's main source of military advice until the end of the war. Australian General Thomas Blamey was appointed the Allied land force commander, but MacArthur did not permit him to command American forces. MacArthur also rejected US Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall 's request that he appoint Australians to senior posts in his General Headquarters. Nevertheless, the partnership between Curtin and MacArthur proved beneficial for Australia between 1942 and 1944, as MacArthur was able to communicate Australian requests for assistance to the US Government. Large numbers of United States military personnel were based in Australia during the first years of the Pacific War.",

          "text": "Part of an eye For other uses, see Pupil (disambiguation) . The pupil is a hole located in the center of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina . It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil. The size of the pupil is controlled by the iris, and varies depending on many factors , the most significant being the amount of light in the environment. The term \"pupil\" was coined by Gerard of Cremona . In humans, the pupil is circular, but its shape varies between species; some cats , reptiles , and foxes have vertical slit pupils, goats and sheep have horizontally oriented pupils, and some catfish have annular types. In optical terms, the anatomical pupil is the eye's aperture and the iris is the aperture stop . The image of the pupil as seen from outside the eye is the entrance pupil , which does not exactly correspond to the location and size of the physical pupil because it is magnified by the cornea . On the inner edge lies a prominent structure, the collarette , marking the junction of the embryonic pupillary membrane covering the embryonic pupil. Function See also: Iris (anatomy) The iris is a contractile structure, consisting mainly of smooth muscle , surrounding the pupil. Light enters the eye through the pupil, and the iris regulates the amount of light by controlling the size of the pupil. This is known as the pupillary light reflex . The iris contains two groups of smooth muscles; a circular group called the sphincter pupillae , and a radial group called the dilator pupillae . When the sphincter pupillae contract, the iris decreases or constricts the size of the pupil.",

          "text": "In bright light, the pupils constrict to prevent aberrations of light rays and thus attain their expected acuity; in the dark, this is not necessary, so it is chiefly concerned with admitting sufficient light into the eye. When bright light is shone on the eye, light-sensitive cells in the retina, including rod and cone photoreceptors and melanopsin ganglion cells , will send signals to the oculomotor nerve , specifically the parasympathetic part coming from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus , which terminates on the circular iris sphincter muscle. When this muscle contracts, it reduces the size of the pupil. This is the pupillary light reflex , which is an important test of brainstem function. Furthermore, the pupil will dilate if a person sees an object of interest. Clinical significance Further information: Pupillary response Effect of drugs If the drug pilocarpine is administered, the pupils will constrict and accommodation is increased due to the parasympathetic action on the circular muscle fibers, conversely, atropine will cause paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) and dilation of the pupil. Certain drugs cause constriction of the pupils, such as opioids . Other drugs, such as atropine , LSD , MDMA , mescaline , psilocybin mushrooms , cocaine and amphetamines may cause pupil dilation. The sphincter muscle has a parasympathetic innervation, and the dilator has a sympathetic innervation. In pupillary constriction induced by pilocarpine, not only is the sphincter nerve supply activated but that of the dilator is inhibited. The reverse is true, so control of pupil size is controlled by differences in contraction intensity of each muscle. Another term for the constriction of the pupil is miosis . Substances that cause miosis are described as miotic. Dilation of the pupil is mydriasis .",

          "text": "The arrangement of the phosphors is the same as that of the electron guns. A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor. A shadow mask tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes, typically in a delta configuration, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors on the face of the tube; blocking all other electrons. Shadow masks that use slots instead of holes are known as slot masks. The holes or slots are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back, if they are not absorbed (e.g. due to local charge accumulation), instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random (wrong) spot on the screen. Another type of color CRT (Trinitron) uses an aperture grille of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result. The shadow mask has a single hole for each triad. The shadow mask is usually 1 ⁄ 2 inch behind the screen. Trinitron CRTs were different from other color CRTs in that they had a single electron gun with three cathodes, an aperture grille which lets more electrons through, increasing image brightness (since the aperture grille does not block as many electrons), and a vertically cylindrical screen, rather than a curved screen. The three electron guns are in the neck (except for Trinitrons) and the red, green and blue phosphors on the screen may be separated by a black grid or matrix (called black stripe by Toshiba). The funnel is coated with aquadag on both sides while the screen has a separate aluminum coating applied in a vacuum, deposited after the phosphor coating is applied, facing the electron gun. The aluminum coating protects the phosphor from ions, absorbs secondary electrons, providing them with a return path, preventing them from electrostatically charging the screen which would then repel electrons and reduce image brightness, reflects the light from the phosphors forwards and helps manage heat.",

Today, Singapore has four official languages, English , Malay , Mandarin , and Tamil . Malay is the ceremonial national language of the country and is the home language to 13% of the population. Although most of the younger generation of non-Malay people are non-proficient in the Malay language, Malay is used in the national anthem of Singapore and also in citations for Singapore orders and decorations and military parade drill commands. Almost all Singaporeans are bilingual since the introduction of Singapore's bilingual language education policy Singapore English , however, remains the de facto lingua franca spoken by Singaporeans today. It is the main language of instruction in all school subjects except for Mother Tongue lessons and also the common language of administration, law and business. In 2009, more than 20 languages were identified as being spoken in Singapore, reflecting a rich linguistic diversity in the city. Literature Main article: Singaporean literature Singaporean literature consists of literary works that is written in either of the 4 official languages. Although these works may be considered as literature works to their specific languages, they are also viewed as a distinct body of literature portraying various aspects of Singapore society and forms a significant part of the culture of Singapore. Singaporean literature in English was first started by the Peranakan community in colonial Singapore during the 1830s. Singaporean English literature first gained notability in 1937, with a poetry known as F.M.S.R. A Poem , written by Teo Poh Leng and was followed by Wang Gungwu 's work, Pulse, in the 1950.",

The Broncos' first drive of the game started at the Steelers' 30-yard line, following a 42-yard punt return by Omar Bolden , but the Broncos were forced to settle on a 28-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Steelers drove to the Broncos' 32-yard line on their next possession and chose to convert a 4th-and-1 instead of attempting a field goal in high winds, but Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib broke up a long pass from Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to wide receiver Markus Wheaton at the goal line. Later in the first quarter, McManus added a 41-yard field goal to give the Broncos a 6–0 lead. The Steelers then drove 80 yards in five plays, and grabbed the lead, with running back Fitzgerald Toussaint rushing for a 1-yard touchdown, then added to their lead early in the second quarter, with a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell . McManus made a 51-yard field goal as time expired in the first half to narrow the Steelers' lead to 10–9. The Broncos' offense converted only one third down out of eight attempts in the first half. Boswell made a 28-yard field goal on the Steelers' first possession of the second half to extend to a 13–9 lead.",

The Broncos got on the scoreboard just before the two-minute warning, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 19-yard touchdown. The Broncos had a chance to cut into the Patriots' lead on their first possession of the second half, however, placekicker Brandon McManus missed wide-right on a 47-yard field goal attempt. Each team proceeded to trade punts on their next two offensive possessions, until Brady connected with wide receiver Brandon Bolden on a 63-yard touchdown pass at the beginning of the fourth quarter to give the Patriots a 21–7 lead. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out, and were forced to punt. However, Patriots' return specialist Chris Harper muffed the punt, which was recovered by Shaquil Barrett at the Patriots' 36-yard line, giving the Broncos new life. Four plays later, the Broncos pulled to within a one-touchdown deficit, with a 15-yard touchdown run by running back C. J. Anderson . The Broncos' defense forced a punt on the Patriots' next possession, which was aided by an offensive holding penalty on guard Tre' Jackson that nullified a 51-yard pass completion from Brady to wide receiver Keshawn Martin on a third-and-long play. The Broncos then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 21-yard field goal by McManus to pull to within 21–17 with 6:12 remaining in the fourth quarter. The two teams traded punts on their next possessions, and with 2:39 remaining and no timeouts, the Broncos forced a Patriots' punt. The Broncos marched down the field and were facing a 2nd-and-goal from the Patriots' 7-yard line, when Osweiler was sacked for an eight-yard loss.",

Authors since the start of the 21st century include Alfian Sa'at and Rachel Heng . Singaporean literature in Malay can be traced back to 1841. One of the earlier known works of Singaporean literature in Malay was written by Abdullah Bin Abdul Kadir, a Malay scribe, with his work Cherita Kapal Asap . Some of the other earlier known Malay writers include Tuan Simi and Masuri S. N. Singaporean Malay literary works were similar to its Malaysian counterpart before the early 1970s. Many early pioneers of Singaporean literature in Malay relocated to Malaysia before Singapore became independent as they wanted to be part of the larger Malay community in Malaysia due to the common language in writing. By the 1970s, due to the difference in governance between Singapore and Malaysia, literary works in Malay between the two countries became more distinguishable, with Singapore literature in Malay revolving around the themes of freedom, authenticity and criticality.

          "text": "Jorge Luis Borges in 1951 At the turn of the 20th century, modernismo emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío 's Azul (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. José Martí , for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere. However, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as Julio Cortázar 's Rayuela (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was Gabriel García Márquez 's Cien años de soledad (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with magic realism , though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was Augusto Roa Bastos 's monumental Yo, el supremo (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as Juan Rulfo , Alejo Carpentier , and above all Jorge Luis Borges were also rediscovered. Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Diamela Eltit , Giannina Braschi , Ricardo Piglia , or Roberto Bolaño . There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimonio , texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as Rigoberta Menchú .",

          "text": "American baseball player (1874–1944) Baseball player Tully Frederick \"Topsy\" Hartsel (June 26, 1874 – October 14, 1944) was an American outfielder in Major League Baseball . He was born in Polk, Ohio , and played for the Louisville Colonels (1898–99), Cincinnati Reds (1900), Chicago Orphans (1901) and Philadelphia Athletics (1902–11), with whom he won the World Series in 1910. Hartsel spent the first three years of his professional career as a part-time outfielder for the Colonels and Reds. In 1901, he enjoyed a breakout season with the Orphans, setting career highs in hits (187), runs (111), doubles (25), home runs (7), total bases (265), batting average (.335), and on-base plus slugging (.889). On September 10, 1901, he established the record for putouts by a left fielder in a nine-inning game, with 11 against the Brooklyn Superbas . In a 14-year, 1,356-game major league career, Hartsel recorded a .276 batting average with 826 runs, 31 home runs, 341 RBI , 247 stolen bases and 837 bases on balls . His career fielding percentage as an outfielder was .956. In the 1905 and 1910 World Series, he hit .227 (5-for-22). Philadelphia manager Connie Mack looked for players with quiet and disciplined personal lives, having seen many players in his playing days destroy themselves and their teams through heavy drinking. Mack himself never drank ; before the 1910 World Series he asked all his players to \"take the pledge\" not to drink during the Series.",

          "text": "The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films. Awards and nominations [ edit ] La Strada won more than fifty international awards, including an Oscar in 1957 for Best Foreign Language Film, the first recipient in that category. Legacy [ edit ] \" La Strada is nothing less than a rite of passage, a vision of perennially failing pig-man. Zampanò is here , at the center of a debased culture once again: a spiritually abandoned savage, who, trudging in a circle, makes a show of breaking voluntarily assumed chains--his destiny to burrow at last in shifting sand with the tide coming in and the sky bereft of illusion, having rejected the Clown and destroyed the Fool in himself.\" Vernon Young, Hudson Review . During Fellini's early film career, he was closely associated with the movement known as neorealism , a set of films produced by the Italian film industry during the post-World War II period, particularly 1945–1952, and characterized by close attention to social context, a sense of historical immediacy, political commitment to progressive social change, and an anti-Fascist ideology. Although there were glimpses of certain lapses in neorealistic orthodoxy in some of his first films as a director, La Strada has been widely viewed as a definitive break with the ideological demands of neorealist theorists to follow a particular political slant or embody a specific \"realist\" style. This resulted in certain critics vilifying Fellini for, as they saw it, reverting to prewar attitudes of individualism, mysticism and preoccupation with \"pure style\". Fellini vigorously responded to this criticism: \"Certain people still think neorealism is fit to show only certain kinds of reality, and they insist that this is social reality. It is a program, to show only certain aspects of life\".",

In Nacional Financiera, Buendía befriended Gerardo Bueno Zirón, who shortly after being appointed as director of the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) offered him a position as director of the institution's Press and Public Relations department in 1973. That year, Henrique González Casanova, the former head of the Political Science department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), invited Buendía to work as a part-time professor, a job that the journalist held until his death in 1984. In December 1976 Buendía left his post in CONACYT to become a full-time columnist. He then worked at El Sol de México , a newspaper owned by Organizacion Editorial Mexicana . After facing some differences with the owners of the print media company, Buendía left on 17 August 1978 to work at El Universal , a newspaper based in Mexico City. Only lasting until December of that year, he left to work at Excélsior , a daily newspaper with one of the largest circulations in Mexico City. At this newspaper, Buendía wrote for the column Red Privada , which was distributed and read in over 200 newspaper across Mexico. In his column he wrote about the covert operations of the CIA in Mexico during the Cold War , ultra-rightwing groups, crooked businessmen, and corrupt government officials involved in drug trafficking. His investigations angered many in Mexico's political elite and made him a frequent target of death threats. Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on his belt or in a leather pocket.",

          "text": "Trust and goodwill [ edit ] Enterprise foundations may earn the trust and goodwill of customers, suppliers, employees, and other stakeholders due to its long-term commitment to philanthropy, charity, employee welfare, contributions etc. Greater trust in the company may result in greater customer loyalty, more engaged employees, more reliable suppliers, more supportive societies and more stable shareholders , which in turn generate greater revenue, lower costs and higher shareholder value . Enterprise foundations may experience \"the mutual commitment hypothesis\". Ownership commitment by enterprise foundations may facilitate organisational commitment by employees in foundation-owned firms. Company commitment to employee welfare may be stronger and more credible in foundation-owned firms due to the long-term and philanthropic nature of foundation ownership. Mitigation of succession challenges [ edit ] Foundation ownership can mitigate the succession challenges and internal conflicts found in family-owned firms. Absence of monetary motive [ edit ] Customers are presumably more likely to buy from a company that has less of an incentive to abuse their trust. The same goes for employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders . Since the enterprise foundation has little or no incentive to break implicit contracts, foundation-owned companies can more credibly negotiate contracts with their stakeholders . The idealistic purpose of an enterprise foundation can help motivate customers, employees and other stakeholders to identify with the firm . The key decision makers in enterprise foundations – the foundation board members – are not rewarded by economic incentives , so they may identify with the foundation and its purpose. Most enterprise foundations have a philanthropic purpose in addition to the business purpose. Since philanthropy is usually paid for by dividends from the company, the philanthropic purpose implies an incentive to generate profits. Criticism of enterprise foundation structure [ edit ] The founder's substantial loss of personal wealth. Strong preference for survival and retaining the foundation may prevent the company from taking part in restructuring or from issuing equity to finance growth. The founder's administrative heritage may lead to excessive conservatism and may impede flexible adaption to new circumstances.",

Inequality [ edit ] Main article: Wealth inequality in Latin America Slums on the outskirts of a wealthy urban area in São Paulo , Brazil. Wealth inequality in Latin America remains a serious issue despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators. A report released in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled Inequality Matters: Report of the World Social Situation , observed that: 'Declines in the wage share have been attributed to the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions.' Such declines are likely to disproportionately affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution , as they rely mostly on wages for income. In addition, the report noted that 'highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency , as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity , while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so. According to the United Nations ECLAC , Latin America is the most unequal region in the world. In 2025, The Economist said that Latin America’s \"tax and welfare systems are shockingly bad at reducing inequality.\" Inequality in Latin America has deep historical roots in the Latin European racially based Casta system instituted in Latin America during colonial times that has been difficult to eradicate because of the differences between initial endowments and opportunities among social groups have constrained the poorest's social mobility , thus causing poverty to transmit from generation to generation, and become a vicious cycle.",

The double-track line had two stations built on it, Tarneit and Wyndham Vale , to housing estates in those areas. The Geelong V/Line rail service was rerouted to use the line, no longer sharing tracks with Werribee line services operated by Metro Trains . Ballarat services only join the alignment at Deer Park, and Bendigo services do not use this line at all; they instead join the other part of the Regional Rail Link at Sunshine . Test trains began operating upon completion of the line in October 2014 and passenger services started on 21 June 2015. Future expansion [ edit ] In 2018 the Andrews Government announced the Western Rail Plan , which included electrification and quadruplication of the line. In 2023, it was reported that the Western Rail Plan no longer included quadruplication and there are no concrete plans to electrify the line. During the 2022 Victorian state election , the Andrews Government committed to building two new infill stations on the corridor, Tarneit West and Truganina .

At Constantinople he waited to board HMS Caradoc for passage into the Black Sea , meeting Florence Nightingale during his wait. In May, the Princess Royal sailed with the combined fleets to Kerch , having taken aboard troops from the 90th Regiment of Foot to be taken ashore. He escaped injury on one occasion when Princess Royal engaged the Russian Constantine Battery , with the fort returning fire resulting in the loss of two men and injury to five others. Cholera struck the ship soon after, lasting for two weeks and claiming eleven lives, though Montagu was unaffected. At some point he injured his foot, which laid him up for three weeks in a cot in Lord Paget's cabin. Montagu as a midshipman When Lord Paget was invalided, he was replaced as captain by Sir Lewis Jones , who retained Montagu in his role as aide-de-camp . He was present for the heaviest bombardment of Sevastopol which took place in September 1855, while in October he sailed with a detachment of the 63rd Foot for their assault on a fortified spit near the entrance of the Sea of Azov . Following the end of the war, Montagu returned to England via Constantinople, where he was a guest of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe , and the Greek Islands , where he had his first experience of yacht racing. For his service in the Crimean War, he was decorated by the Ottoman Empire with the Order of the Medjidie , Fifth Class in April 1858, at which point he held the rank of midshipman .

          "text": "Romanian Romani activist, writer and businessman (1892-?) Gheorghe A. Lăzăreanu-Lăzurică or George Lăzurică , also known as Lăzărescu-Lăzurică or Lăzărică (1892 – ?), was a leader of the Romani (Gypsy) community in Romania , also remembered for his support of Romania's interwar far-right. Originally a musician and formally trained entrepreneur from an assimilated background, he became conscious about his ethnic roots while serving with the Romanian Land Forces in World War I. A pioneer of Romani-themed literature, he became active within the General Association of Gypsies in Romania in 1933, but broke away that same year to establish the (eventually more powerful) General Union of Roma in Romania. From September 1933 to May 1934, Lăzurică was also a \" Voivode of the Gypsies \", recognized as such by various local tribes. He and his followers came to resent ethnic designation as \"Gypsies\", and pleaded for the usage of \"Romanies\", first proposed to them by Nicolae Constantin Batzaria . Lăzurică himself tried to introduce the term Zgripți as a reference to the people's legendary ancestors. Though credited with inventing Romani political symbolism and noted for invoking a worldwide tribal identity, Lăzurică and his followers abstained from Romani nationalist activism, preferring to focus on social reform, and accepted some measure of integration with mainstream Romanian society. The General Union cooperated with the Romanian Orthodox Church , spreading Christianity among nomads whom it helped to settle, and competing for baptisms with the Romanian Greek Catholics .",

They were assisted by an executive bureau, whose members included Ispas Borbely, Nicolae Gheorghe Lache, Apostol Matei, Vasile Mureșeanu, and Niculae I. Sarru. Some weeks later, Lăzurică tried to obtain Niculescu's indictment on battery charges, while Niculescu himself reported him for fraud; both accusations were being assessed by the same prosecutor, Benedict Stoenescu. On September 10, 1934, the Voivode presided upon his own Romani congress at Sibiu ; in a series of \"10 commandments\", delegates were asked to submit to both him and the Orthodox Church, to love Romania and its king, and to not steal or have sex outside marriage. Commenting on this document, journalist V. Munteanu suggested that Lăzurică had embraced dictatorial means without having the needed charisma, and that his channeling of Orthodoxy would naturally alienate Romanies of other religious backgrounds. The congress of Sibiu was soon followed by rallies at Diciosânmartin (October 1934) and Ploiești (April 1935). As noted by Ellenzék newspaper, he had grouped a new circle of loyalists, including architect Andrei (András) Zima of Blaj, \"who outlined the self-sacrificing work of Grand Voivode G. A. Lăzurică in unifying all Gypsies\"; other disciples were Adam Bunaciu of Târnava-Mică and Gheorghe Sicra of Târnava-Mare .",

Integration and nationalism [ edit ] Bicolor version of the Romani flag , reportedly used by the UGRR One of the key goals of the UGRR was in convincing members and outsiders to use romi (\"Romanies\") over țigani , which it viewed as derogatory. News reports of the 1933 congress and its aftermath used the term, but often in quotation marks, indicating that it \"was not fully accepted by the Romanian public opinion.\" Lăzurică himself extended the neologism to mean \"freedom-loving man\", rather than simply \"man\", and claimed that it had etymological links to Ramayana . As argued by Matei, he had had no objection to using țigani as an endonym during his association with Șerboianu, and had left several written statements describing himself as a \"Gypsy\". Matei notes that the newer term was most likely suggested to him by Nicolae Constantin Batzaria , the Romanian head editor at Adevărul . In his column of September 5, 1933, Batzaria had chided Șerboianu for using an implicitly demeaning and hostile term, arguing for romi as both authentic and preferable. Lăzurică's first documented use of romi is dated by Matei to October 1933, in a manifesto which repeats Batzaria's attack on Șerboianu. His newfound appreciation for the term was challenged by the more senior activist Naftanailă, who, by 1934, had reconciled with the word țigani and was using it in the title of his rival newspaper, Neamul Țigănesc .",

Rs. 3.5 billion (US$12 million) was pledged to be spent on the complete renovation of the KCR, however within the year the first phase was shut down. 30 April 2010 : Minister of Railways Ghulam Ahmad Bilour stated construction work would begin in 2010.

In 2005, two middle-class women from Bolivia that co-founded AZ they tried to establish an empowerment training class. Empowerment training, is used under the term of gender politics , which means it is only for women. A project was created for women to have an economic opportunity to help them earn income, and advance in economic development . They were given the option to create a stone pathway and would be paid for their work. If this project is what the women wanted to do, then the two middle-class women would bring the project proposal to the mayor's office in order to start the project. However, the women did not like this idea, because they thought their opportunity would take away from their husband's opportunity to earn money. Another reason was that there was another responsibility placed on the women besides taking care of their families. The women asked for the proposal to include men because they thought that because as husbands they were companions in development, not contestants. Their identity as a partner and a wife to their husbands is intertwined with progress of economic development. In the end, the women in charge proposed to analyze the differences in power between men and women, among the poor and middle class. Many Bolivian women have a different perception on the AZ and its purpose when it comes to economic opportunity and community development. The women's perception is to have men get local jobs so there would be no need for them to travel a far distance to their job. This idea was presented by the local government. The project proposal was to help the women improve themselves and their community. The women wanted to give men the opportunity also, instead of creating competition between the two genders. In another part of Bolivia, there are a group of indigenous women activists that do participate politically and want to decolonize. An indigenous group, the Aymaras believe in the term Chachawarmi, which means to have men and women be represented equally.",

          "text": "What? Go to her anyway!' ... That's how he's able ... to use performers from many countries. He does part of the acting for the actors.\" Since Quinn and Basehart did not speak Italian, both were dubbed in the original release. Unhappy with the actor who initially dubbed Zampanò, Fellini remembered being impressed by the work done by Arnoldo Foà in dubbing the Toshiro Mifune character in the Italian version of Akira Kurosawa 's Rashomon , and was able to secure Foà's services at the very last moment. Composer Michel Chion has observed that Fellini particularly exploited the tendency of Italian films of the post-war period to allow considerable freedom in the synching of voices to lip movements, especially in contrast to Hollywood's perceived \"obsessive fixation\" with the matching of voices to mouths: \"In Fellinian extremes, when all those post-synched voices float around bodies, we reach a point where voices—even if we continue to attribute them to the bodies they're assigned—begin to acquire a sort of autonomy, in a baroque and decentered fashion.\" In the Italian version of La Strada , there are even instances when a character is heard to speak while the actor's mouth is shut tight. Fellini scholar Thomas Van Order has pointed out that Fellini is equally free in the treatment of ambient sound in his films, preferring to cultivate what Chion called \"a subjective sense of point of audition\", in which what is heard on screen mirrors a particular character's perceptions, as opposed to the visible reality of the scene. As an example, ducks and chickens appear on the screen throughout Gelsomina's conversation with the nun, but, reflecting the girl's growing sense of enlightenment concerning her place in the world, the quacking and clucking of barnyard fowl dissolves into the chirping of songbirds.",

          "text": "Intuitively, minimal liberalism captures an aspect of individual freedom: for some issues, if you prefer x over y (or vice versa), then society respects your preference for x over y even if everyone else is against you. Sen's example is your personal preference for sleeping on your back or your side: on at least one innocuous personal area like this, a liberal society ought to prioritize your individual preference even if everyone else in society would prefer you to sleep another way. The formal requirement is that at least two people are decisive in this way, to rule out the possibility of a single person who dictates society's preferences. In other words, the liberal paradox states that for every social choice function F , there is a configuration of preference relations p ∊ Rel(X) for which F violates either Pareto optimality or Minimal liberalism (or both). In the examples of Sen and Gibbard noted above, the social choice function satisfies minimal liberalism at the expense of Pareto optimality. Ways out of the paradox [ edit ] Because the paradox relies on very few conditions, there are a limited number of ways to escape the paradox. Essentially one must either reject the universal domain assumption, the Pareto principle , or the minimal liberalism principle . Sen himself suggested two ways out, one a rejection of universal domain another a rejection of the Pareto principle. Universal domain [ edit ] Julian Blau proves that Sen's paradox can only arise when individuals have \"nosy\" preferences—that is when their preference depends not only on their own action but also on others' actions. In the example of Alice and Bob above, Alice has a preference over how Bob paints his house, and Bob has a preference over Alice's house color as well. Most arguments which demonstrate market efficiency assume that individuals care about only their own consumption and not others' consumption and therefore do not consider the situations that give rise to Sen's paradox.",

          "text": "British actor (1866–1951) Alf Collins pioneer of cinematograph Alfred Collins ( Walworth , 19 June 1866 – 20 December 1951 Clapham ) was a British theatre actor who later became a silent film director and actor. His shorts include Rescued by Lifeboat (1906), The Lady Athlete; or, Jiu-Jitsu Downs the Footpads (1907), and The Dancing Girl (1908). Early films were produced with nitrate film and deteriorated in their storage tins, sometimes catching fire, so most of them are lost. There survives approximately 45 films that have been found so far that Collins either acted in or produced, including fourteen rare Edwardian films screened in 2014 at an event called Gaumont Comes Home. This event was held on the original site of Collins's outdoor stage, of the Gaumont film studios, in Camberwell. The event included the film When Extremes Meet (1905), which is 150 feet long, with Collins dressed in Cockney costume. How Percy Won the Beauty Competition (1909) is a comic chase film set in the fields and nearby streets of his outdoor stage. Between 1904 and 1908, Gaumont also produced a number of sound-disc films known as \"Chronophones\". One of these – It Was A Nice Quiet Morning (1907) – has survived and has now been synchronised with an original recording provided by local film collector Bob Geoghegan. This appears to be the only surviving British talking film made prior to World War I . Early films were either copied or the ideas used by showmen or other film companies, so copyright was introduced. Some of these films only exist today because they were copyrighted between 1895 to 1912 with the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., or with National Archives in Kew UK.",

North Africa showing the progress of Operation Compass and strategic locations The 6th Division went into action at Bardia on 3 January 1941. Although a larger Italian force manned the fortress, with the support of British tanks and artillery the Australian infantry quickly penetrated the defensive lines. The majority of the Italian force surrendered on 5 January, and the Australians took 40,000 prisoners. The 6th Division followed up this success by assaulting the fortress of Tobruk on 21 January. Tobruk was secured the next day, with 25,000 Italian prisoners taken. The 6th Division subsequently pushed west along the coast road to Cyrenaica and captured Benghazi on 4 February. The 6th Division withdrew for deployment to Greece later in February and was replaced by the untested 9th Division, which took up garrison duties in Cyrenaica . In the last week of March 1941, a German-led force launched an offensive in Cyrenaica which rapidly defeated the Allied forces in the area, forcing a general withdrawal towards Egypt (April 1941). The 9th Division formed the rear guard of this withdrawal, and on 6 April, was ordered to defend the important port town of Tobruk for at least two months.",

The Americans across the Kall Valley at Kommerscheidt held on until November 8, when an order to withdraw was given. The positions at Schmidt and the Kall Trail were abandoned. It wasn't until February 1945 that the 82nd Airborne Division permanently captured the Kall Trail and Schmidt. A German regimental doctor, Hauptmann Günter Stüttgen , negotiated an unofficial ceasefire with the Americans at the Kall Bridge from 7–12 November, in order to attend to the wounded of both sides, numbering in the thousands. The lives of many American soldiers were saved by German medics. Second phase [ edit ] Main article: Operation Queen A German infantry gun firing in defense against a U.S. attack on 22 November 1944 in the Hürtgen forest The second phase was part of Operation Queen , the Allied thrust to the Rur River. In this phase, the U.S. 4th Infantry Division was to clear the northern half of the forest between Schevenhütte and Hürtgen, capture Hürtgen, and advance to the Rur south of Düren. From 10 November, this would be VII Corps′ responsibility and it was part of the main VII Corps effort to reach the Rur. The 4th Division was now fully committed to the Hürtgen, although its 12th Infantry Regiment was already mauled from its action at Schmidt, leaving just two fully effective regiments to achieve the divisional objectives. U.S. VII Corps was opposed by German forces, mainly from the LXXXI Corps, consisting of three understrength divisions.",

The use of spoons, and more recently forks, is also increasing, and inquiring if one is available is acceptable. The washing of hands and mouth is not necessary, before or after, when eating with a spoon. In Nepal, especially among the Brahmin and Chhetri castes, the purity of food and drinks is taken very seriously. Contact with saliva is almost universally considered to make food impure, which is considered to be jutho and may be seen as a sign of insult or grave ignorance. Acceptability of jutho food follows the traditional hierarchy of respect, where parents' jutho is acceptable to children but not vice-versa and so on. People of equal standing, like friends and spouses may also share jutho , except among highly religious (where jutho is impure) or traditional people (where jutho is thought to transfer diseases, or husbands may be held superior to wives). In a similar vein, food touched by pets and other animals, or where an insect drops, are discarded and the containers thoroughly washed. Some exceptions may be made for animals traditionally thought pure, such as cows.",

Middle-class families residing in cities consume these foods on a daily basis. One can find them in almost all the restaurants around cities. Etiquette [ edit ] Although most homes and restaurants in cities have dining tables, meals in villages are often eaten seated on a tiny wooden seat (pira) or on chairs or benches. A large mound of bhat , dhindo or a pile of rotis is served on a jharke thal (a large brass plate) or a khande thal (a compartment plate). On the jharke thal , the rice is surrounded by smaller mounds of prepared vegetables, fresh chutney or preserved pickles, and sometimes curd/yogurt, fish or meat. Separate glasses and bowls are instead used for different dishes, while serving on smaller plates or when serving to honoured guest or elders of the family. The most notable of this is the separate thals and bowls that are given to elders and honoured guests that are made of a separate metal alloy ( jharke ). Although it is vague on the specifics to what jharke can be quantified to be due to the change in the actual metallic composition of jharke for the past few generations and there being no one standard. Thus, jharke thals , bowls etc. can all vary in appearance from locality, era, craftsmanship, and more, however the sentiment still remains. On a khande thal , there are separate small compartments for chutney and tarkari and other dishes. Food is traditionally eaten with the right hand. Touching or eating food with the left hand, which is traditionally used for washing off after stool, is considered unhygienic, and taboo.",

When Awe, the arrogant monkey, climbed up to the heavens to try to show Mawu that he too could give life, he failed miserably.

He explicitly criticises Van De Mieroop's comments that ancient Egypt was clearly 'in Africa' it was not so clearly 'of Africa' as reflecting \"long-standing Egyptological biases\". He concluded that the interrelated cultural features shared between northeast African dynamic and Pharaonic Egypt are not \"survivals\" or coincidence, but shared traditions with common origins in the deep past\". Andrea Manzo wrote in 2022 that early Egyptologists had situated the origins of dynastic Egypt within a \"broad Hamitic horizon that characterised several regions of Africa\" and that these views had continued to dominate in the second half of the twentieth century. Manzo stated more recent studies had \"pointed out the relevance of African elements to the rise of Egyptian culture, following earlier suggestions on Egyptian kingship and religion by Henri Frankfort \" which countered the traditional view that considered Egypt \"more closely linked to the Near East than to the rest of Africa\". Ehret recounted in 2023 that the previous two centuries of Western scholarship had presented Egypt as an \"offshoot of earlier Middle Eastern developments\". He continued to argue that these old ideas had influenced the attitudes of scholars in other disciplines such as genetics and their approaches. Ehret was especially critical of the sampling methods and wider conclusions of a 2017 genetic study which conflicted with existing archaeological , linguistic , genetic and biological anthropological evidence.",

          "text": "The key term 'multistakeholder' (or 'multistakeholderism') is increasingly spelled without a hyphen to maintain consistency with its predecessor 'multilateralism' and to associate this new form of governance with one of the key actors involved that is also generally spelled without a hyphen; ' multinationals '. 'Multistakeholderism' is similarly used in parallel to bilateralism and regionalism . As an evolving global governance form, only a limited number of organizations and institutions are involved in multistakeholderism. In a number of arenas, opposing forces are actively challenging the legitimacy, accountability, and effectiveness of these experimental changes in global governance. Contemporary history and theory [ edit ] Stakeholder management theory , stakeholder project management theory, and stakeholder government agency theory have all contributed to the intellectual foundation for multistakeholder governance. The history and theory of multistakeholder governance however departs from these models in four ways. The earlier theories describe how a central institution (be it a business, a project, or a government agency) should engage more formally with related institutions (be it other organizations, institutions, or communities). In multistakeholder governance, the central element of multistakeholder undertaking is a public concern (e.g. protection of the climate, management of the internet, or the use of natural resources), not a pre-existing organization. Second, the earlier theories aimed to strengthen a pre-existing institution. In multistakeholder governance, multistakeholder groups can strengthen associated institutions but they can also marginalize institutions or functions of existing governance bodies (e.g. governmental regulatory authorities, UN system). As earlier theories were concerned with improving the operations of corporations and project management, they did not need to address the public governance consequences of multistakeholder decision-making.",

Marius's names were not widely adopted until centuries later (mid-20th century). In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Io was generally referred to by its Roman numeral designation (a system introduced by Galileo) as \" Jupiter I \", or as \"the first satellite of Jupiter\". The customary English pronunciation of the name is / ˈ aɪ oʊ / , though sometimes people attempt a more 'authentic' pronunciation, / ˈ iː oʊ / . The name has two competing stems in Latin: Īō and (rarely) Īōn . The latter is the basis of the English adjectival form, Ionian. Features on Io are named after characters and places from the Io myth, as well as deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from Dante's Inferno : names appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface. Since the surface was first seen up close by Voyager 1 , the International Astronomical Union has approved 249 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features. The approved feature categories used for Io for different types of volcanic features include patera ('saucer'; volcanic depression), fluctus ('flow'; lava flow), vallis ('valley'; lava channel), and active eruptive center (location where plume activity was the first sign of volcanic activity at a particular volcano). Named mountains, plateaus, layered terrain , and shield volcanoes include the terms mons , mensa ('table'), planum , and tholus ('rotunda'), respectively. Named, bright albedo regions use the term regio .",

Barringer, relying on earlier studies of Olympia, states \"This whole structure framed a basin into which water flowed from a 1km-long aqueduct, which came from the south along the north-south path east of the Leonidaion.\" However, the rule that water flows downhill, being a law of nature as we know it, is invariant. The Nymphaion was made the high point of the park for a reason. Olympia is on a slope of the Alfeios valley at the very foot of the hills above it. The slope is toward the Alfeios on the south; aqueducts cannot come from there unless from the hills on the other side of the valley, for which there is even less evidence. The channel taken as influent must be effluent. Adler's 1km quoted by Barringer has no meaning out of context; discounting the Alfeios itself, there are no sources 1km away except to the north, beyond the Kronos hill. In Ch. 5 Plate 1, Barringer has the real aqueduct labeled as a retaining wall, which it can't be, since there is no loose or rocky slope to retain. The wall instead is retained from toppling by metal braces. Citations [ edit ] ^ Aristodimou, Georgia (2008). \"Nymphaea in Asia Minor\" .

          "text": "It is important to note that membrane scaling is not only dependent on supersaturation but also on crystallization kinetics, i.e., nucleation and crystal growth . Scaling compounds encountered in RO [ edit ] The most common salts that cause scaling in RO processes are: Calcium carbonate Calcium sulfate Silica/ metal silicates Barium sulfate Calcium phosphate Scaling prediction methods [ edit ] There are a number of indices available to determine the scaling tendency of sparingly soluble salts in a water solution. These indices provide information if a given scale-forming specie is undersaturated , saturated, or supersaturated. Scaling does not occur when a compound is undersaturated, while it will take place sooner or later when a compound is supersaturated. The most commonly used indices to predict scaling in RO applications are: Saturation index (SI) S I = log ⁡ I A P K s p {\\displaystyle SI=\\log {\\frac {IAP}{K_{sp}}}} where, IAP and K sp are ion activity product and solubility product of the sparingly soluble salt, respectively. For instance, SI for calcium sulphate can be calculated as follows: S I = log ⁡ γ [ C a 2 + ] γ [ S O 4 2 − ] K s p {\\displaystyle SI=\\log {\\frac {\\gamma [Ca^{2+}]\\gamma [SO_{4}^{2-}]}{Ksp}}} where, γ is activity coefficient . [Ca ] and [SO 4 ] are calcium and sulphate concentrations in mol/L, respectively. Supersaturation ratio (S r ) S r = √ I A P K s p {\\displaystyle S_{r}=\\surd {\\frac {IAP}{K_{sp}}}} where IAP and Ksp are ion activity product and solubility product of the sparingly soluble salt, respectively.",

The social planner decides that they should be committed to individual rights, each individual should get to choose whether they, themself will read the book. Lewd should get to decide whether the outcome \"Lewd reads\" will be ranked higher than \"No one reads\", and similarly Prude should get to decide whether the outcome \"Prude reads\" will be ranked higher than \"No one reads\". Following this strategy, the social planner declares that the outcome \"Lewd reads\" will be ranked higher than \"No one reads\" (because of Lewd's preferences) and that \"No one reads\" will be ranked higher than \"Prude reads\" (because of Prude's preferences). Consistency then requires that \"Lewd reads\" be ranked higher than \"Prude reads\", and so the social planner gives the book to Lewd to read. Notice that this outcome is regarded as worse than \"Prude reads\" by both Prude and Lewd, and the chosen outcome is therefore Pareto inferior to another available outcome—the one where Prude is forced to read the book. Gibbard's example [ edit ] Another example was provided by philosopher Allan Gibbard . Suppose there are two individuals Alice and Bob who live next door to each other. Alice loves the color blue and hates red. Bob loves the color green and hates yellow. If each were free to choose the color of their house independently of the other, they would choose their favorite colors. But Alice hates Bob with a passion, and she would gladly endure a red house if it meant that Bob would have to endure his house being yellow. Bob similarly hates Alice, and would gladly endure a yellow house if that meant that Alice would live in a red house.",

There were 6 acres of woodland and 100 acres of pasture. The manor was valued at £2 though it had formerly been worth £4. Although the civil parish is shown under Tywardreath and Par , there is an electoral ward (which also includes Par ) shown under the name of Tywardreath only. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,897. Tywardreath Priory [ edit ] The settlement grew out of a Benedictine priory established at around the time of the Norman conquest . Founded from the Abbey of SS Sergius and Bacchus, Angers in France, it was founded to contain only about seven monks, the endowment being sufficient for that number. The house was poor but powerful in the area, controlling the port of Fowey and having lands scattered over Cornwall. Being regarded as an alien priory subject to a French mother house, the Crown frequently took it into its 'protection', taking all its temporal income for itself, as the alien houses' loyalty to the English crown was suspect, and they were sending profits from their English lands to \"enemies\" abroad. The Crown's action transferred the money from the coffers of a French abbot to those of an English king. The result was a poor, demoralised monastery, devoid of its monks, who were expelled in the early 1400s. A slow revival from about 1406 brought English monks into the house, and it regained its prestige and much of the property it had lost, having become 'denizen', i.e. naturalised as English.",

On 8 May, Alrababah, Hanjour, al-Hazmi, Moqed, and al-Ghamdi traveled to Fairfield to look for housing. While there, they also called several local flight schools. They then travelled briefly to Paterson to look at that area as well. Rababah has contended that, after this trip, he never saw any of the men again. Sometime at the end of May 2001, Hanjour rented a one-bedroom apartment in Paterson, New Jersey . He lived there with at least one roommate and was visited by several other hijackers, including Mohamed Atta . During his time in New Jersey , he and al-Hazmi rented three different cars including a sedan in June that Hanjour cosigned with the alias \"Hani Saleh Hassan\". He later made his last phone call to his family back in Saudi Arabia, during which he claimed to be phoning from a payphone in the United Arab Emirates , where he was supposedly still working. Hanjour, along with at least five other future hijackers, are believed to have traveled to Las Vegas several times in mid-2001, where they allegedly drank alcohol, gambled, and visited lap dancing clubs . On 20 July, Hanjour flew to the Montgomery County Airpark in Maryland from New Jersey on a practice flight with fellow hijacker Nawaf al-Hazmi . On 1 August, Hanjour and al-Mihdhar returned to Falls Church to obtain fraudulent documentation at a 7-Eleven convenience store where an illegal side business operated for such a service. There they met Luis Martinez-Flores , himself also an illegal immigrant , who agreed to help them for a $100 fee.",

Philippe de France, Duke of Orléans was the brother of Louis XIV and the younger son of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria . A member of the House of Bourbon , he is the founder of the current House of Orléans . His heirs formed a junior collateral branch of the royal dynasty. They include the second duke , who governed France during the minority of Louis XV in the Regency era; one French monarch, Louis Philippe I ; and the Orléanist pretenders to the French throne still flourishing in the 21st century. The accumulation of the vast wealth which the House of Orléans would possess and use to influence both politics and court life (until it was confiscated during the French Revolution ) began with Philippe, a lifelong beneficiary of his brother's largesse. He was originally known by the title \"Duke of Anjou\". In 1660, his paternal uncle, Gaston, Duke of Orléans , died. The dukedom of Orléans was an appanage traditionally conferred upon the younger brother of the French king whenever available. Philippe exchanged Anjou for Orléans. As a son of a French king, Philippe ranked as a fils de France , and as the king's younger brother, he was invariably referred to at court simply as Monsieur .

          "text": "Paula Todd , a lawyer and media professor, raised the question of how many of the jury members would listen to the judge's instructions to avoid accessing online coverage. Law professor Mary Anne Franks said, \"[I]t's crazy to think they are not going to be influenced by what's happening on social media,\" further noting that she encountered out-of-context, distorted depictions of the trial despite trying to avoid reading about the case. Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond School of Law professor, said \"I don't envy the judge—or the jurors—because it's hard to protect them from [outside] influences,\" noting that such outside influences inhibit the justice system's ability to \"give people a fair day in court.\" Following the trial, a juror denied that the jury had been influenced by social media, saying, \"We followed the evidence. We didn't take into account anything outside [...] They were very serious accusations and a lot of money involved. So we weren't taking it lightly.\" Comments by juror [ edit ] Following the trial, a juror was interviewed by Good Morning America . The juror stated that he found that Depp and Heard \"were both abusive to each other\" but that Heard's team failed to prove that Depp's abuse was physical. \"They had their husband-wife arguments. They were both yelling at each other, I don't think that makes either of them right or wrong [...] But to rise to the level of what she was claiming, there wasn't enough or any evidence that really supported what she was saying\". The juror opined that Heard's testimony was not \"believable\" because it \"seemed like she was able to flip the switch on her emotions\", while Depp \"seemed a little more real in terms of how he responded to questions\".",

For some time she lived with her mother in Warsaw . In 1819 she published her first book, Pamiątka po dobrej matce, czyli ostatnie jej rady dla córki ( A Souvenir After a Good Mother, or Her Final Advice to Her Daughter ), a monologue in which an older woman imparts final words of wisdom and advice to a daughter. In 1829 she married Karol Boromeusz Hoffman , writer, lawyer and historian, and changed her name to Hoffmanowa, a marital form of her husband's surname. After Poland's November Uprising against the Russian Empire was crushed in the second half of 1831, Hoffmanowa moved with her husband to Dresden , and later settled in Paris . She was called \"the Mother of the Great Emigration ”. In 1919 a Warsaw high school, one of the oldest in the country, was named after her.

He found in his own circle there, that it had been \"much blessed.\" He learned, also, that \" my lord of Exeter had said, he wrote like an honest man, and has recanted several things ; \" but, added Lavington, \" he goes on in the same way yet.\" He did. He went to Exeter, and appeared in the fields again. The bishop therefore threatened another pamphlet. ... He did not answer him. He did better. He went to Exeter, accompanied by a rural dean, to preach the gospel as usual; and divine influence accompanied the word. \"This,\" he says, \"is, I think, the best way to answer those who oppose themselves.\" He preached there twice on the same day.",

          "text": "The principle of syllabic symmetry was dominant. A twelve-syllable verse with a caesura after the fifth or sixth syllable was used; there are, for example, such complex schemes as: 5-6-8|8-6-5|7-7-4-5-3-5 (12 verses of Irmos \" Земьнъ къто слыша таковая \"...) or 8|5-5-5|8-8|5-5-5 (9 verses of Irmos \" Вьсъ еси желание \"...) There were also schemes where the number of syllables in each verse was a multiple of three (from St. Trinity, the sacred number \"three\" for Christians). The detailed life in the monastery can be judged by the syllabic poem by Karion Istomin \"About speaking from people, how monks live in the monastery\": Мънози глаголют, что монахи деют, где в монастыре дела не имеют. Бутто так сидят, ничего не знают, како ли Богу честь, поклон взношают. Надобно кому себе искусити и в монастыре хоть время прожити. Узнает, как кто в кельи пребывает, како помыслы, страсти отвергеет ... Translation: Many say that monks are idle that they have no tasks in a monastery. As if they are just sitting so, knowing nothing, only how to honor God, how to bow down to Him. Test yourselves with the experience and at least live in a monastery for a while.",

          "text": "Despite work on Metamoru Kid Gūmin being nearly complete, development was later halted due to Bullet-Proof Software changing their direction. Afterwards, Ukiyotei started negotiations with Japanese publisher Visit, who proposed to the team with reusing the same game engine written for Metamoru Kid Gūmin on a new project but the arrival of PlayStation in Japanese markets led Ukiyotei focusing towards the western market of the Super Famicom instead. Kenshi claimed that Punky's design and main method of attack were a product of Visit, who told the team that \"this incorporated the opinions of North American buyers\". Although work on the Super Famicom version of Punky Skunk was nearly completed, the launch of the PlayStation in North America and the subsequent decrease in the 16-bit market for Super Famicom titles resulted in suspending its development. Ukiyotei would later propose Visit in resuming Punky and continue development of Punky Skunk on PlayStation, to which the latter agreed at the request of elements such as the visuals matched the system's capabilities. The programming team used Punky as research in order to code previous techniques they were able to perform with Super Famicom on PlayStation such as character animation and parallax scrolling , as software development kits for the latter console were deemed to be not suitable for 2D titles, converting several elements from the former version while finishing level design and other aspects during the process. Screenshot from the unreleased Super Famicom version Punky Skunk was created by most of the same team that previously worked on Skyblazer for the Super Famicom at Ukiyotei. Development was helmed by Kaori and Kenshi Naruse acting as directors , with Kenshi also being its sole game designer .",

          "text": "Castle was generally positive about the game's aesthetics, citing the water effects as particularly good. Edge was fairly mixed, saying that well-done environmental effects or the world-building through character banter were spoiled by low-quality textures and stilted character animations. Juba praised the character models, but found environments to be \"ugly and muddy in comparison\"; Fuller, while not actively criticizing them, said that players used to high-definition consoles would be disappointed. GameTrailers found the amount of detail put into environments \"remarkable\" for the Wii hardware despite a lack of scale, while Parkin found the visuals generally unimpressive despite a few stand-out moments. Nintendo Power said that the graphics gave the game's setting an \"authentic\" appearance despite some low-resolution textures, while Eurogamer praised them for their \"sepia tone\". Frame rate drops during moments of high activity were generally noted by reviewers. Uematsu's incidental scoring also received praise from multiple critics. Sales and accolades [ edit ] Upon release, The Last Story topped Japanese gaming charts, selling 114,722 units. Assessments by Media Create stated that while the game had achieved higher sales than Xenoblade Chronicles due to higher interest in the title, Wii hardware sales remained low, indicating that the title was mostly bought by gamers who already owned a Wii console. By the end of 2011, the game sold just over 157,000 units. Upon its release in the UK, it debuted at #15. After the release of The Last Story in North America, Xseed Games released a statement saying that The Last Story was their most successful title to date, with its Premium Edition selling out quickly and needing to be replaced with a different special edition. Upon its release, the game received critical acclaim, earning an aggregate score of 80/100 on Metacritic based on 61 critic reviews. It was cited by GamesRadar and Forbes as one of the best games of the year.",

Decline [ edit ] The Depression Era [ edit ] See also: Ybor City cigar makers' strike of 1931 The markedly decreased demand for cigars during the Great Depression of the 1930s had serious consequences for Ybor City. Many smokers found themselves unable to afford luxury items and switched to cheaper cigarettes, weakening the neighborhood's dominant industry and starting the area on a slow economic and social decline. As occurred elsewhere, many businesses laid off workers or closed altogether and many banks failed. To help keep food on the table during hard times, many residents of Ybor City plowed under their yards or vacant lots to plant vegetables and bought cows, goats, and chickens to provide milk, eggs, and meat for the family, with any surplus sold around town. The descendants of those chickens still roam the area. Tampa and the Spanish Civil War [ edit ] During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, the cry of \" No pasaran! \" energized Ybor City much as the cause of Cuba Libre had done so 40 years previously. The community overwhelmingly supported the democratically elected government of Republican Spain in its fight against the fascist uprising led by General Franco , and many residents donated 10% of their salary and tons of old clothes to the Republican cause. Ybor City during the war had the 2nd largest pro-Republican Spanish speaking population in the United States. A cigar worker turned the slogan of the Republicans, No pasaran! (They shall not pass!), into a song which was sung at rallies in both Tampa and in Spain. In Tampa \"at least two dozen\" volunteers for the Republicans were recruited. Most of the Spanish speaking members of the Lincoln Battalion , came from Ybor City or New York City.",

Over 30,000 troops (about double Tampa's total population at the time ) and thousands of railcars full of supplies arrived to await orders to ship out, providing sudden prosperity for local businesses but stretching the small town's resources to the limit. The troops were particularly welcome in Ybor City by Cubans who surmised that \"Cuba Libre\" was finally within reach. They were correct. The war lasted only a few months, and ended with Spain losing most of her remaining colonial possessions. Some Cubans jubilantly left Tampa for their homeland, eager to enjoy the fruits of their long-fought revolution. However, most of these would eventually return. The main factors in their decision was the lack of economic opportunities and general devastation resulting from years of conflict, and the realization that Spanish colonial control had simply been replaced by American neo-colonial control. As a group, they overwhelmingly choose to put down roots and settle in Ybor City for the long term, though some migration for family and work reasons continued. The \"Golden Age\": 1902–1929 [ edit ] With the turn of the 20th century, the perception of Ybor City residents had evolved. Previously, many residents had thought of Tampa as a temporary place to work and live; a refuge from the political and/or economic troubles in their homelands. By the early 1900s, however, attitudes had changed. Ybor City had become a permanent home. One major factor was the neighborhood's high quality of life. Like most immigrant communities at the time, Ybor City had everything a recent arrival could need: work, shops, schools, churches, and most importantly, other immigrants who shared the language and customs of the old country.",

These divorces could come about because of Pauline privilege , where the church nullified a marriage because neither spouse had been baptized. Marriages could also be nullified if one spouse was baptized and the other not, as the Catholic spouse could not live as a faithful Catholic because of their spouse's lack of faith. As a result, the Catholic spouse could remarry another Catholic with whom they could live peacefully. Another way a Catholic divorce could occur was known as petrino , a similar formula created by Pope Pius XI. A divorce could be granted if the married coupled included a Catholic and non-Catholic spouse, where the Catholic spouse wanted the separation in order to marry a Catholic. Divorce in the late Franco period and early transition was available via ecclesiastical tribunals. These courts could nullify marriage for a fee. Consequently, they were mostly available only to the rich, the most famous instance of this nullification involving Isabel Preysler and Carmencita Martínez Bordiú . The Civil Courts were only involved in separation procedures at the provisional level. The Catholic Church was actively opposed to civil divorce in the mid and late 1970s. Democratic transition period (1975—1982) [ edit ] See also: Spanish democratic transition For many people in Spain, the period that marked the start of Spain's transition to democracy began on 20 December 1973 with the death of Luis Carrero Blanco as a result of an attack by ETA. The end of the transition period is generally considered to be 1982, with the elections that saw the PSOE come to power. Franco died in November 1975. Ahead of the first democratic elections, in 1977 following Franco's death, Spaniards overwhelmingly supported the legalizing of divorce.",

          "text": "Performance is relatively slow and laborious and the process is subject to errors resulting from constraints of information, time, understanding, intelligence and distractions. During emergencies, well-reasoned responses are often substituted by inappropriate and unsuccessful reactions. Error mechanisms [ edit ] Three error mechanisms can be defined which correlate the error categories with human performance levels: Skill-based slips, lapses, and fumbles , where the plan is good but execution is not, due to inattention, distraction, confusion, or simply inadequate ability. Rule-based mistakes , where a good rule is misapplied, a bad rule applied, or there is a failure to apply a good rule. Knowledge-based mistakes , where a cognitive error is made in an attempt to analyse an unfamiliar problem. Violations [ edit ] Violations are a special category of mistakes where someone intentionally fails to apply a good rule, or deviates from acceptable or desirable practice. Four categories of violations may be identified: Routine violations, which involve cutting corners, or taking short cuts, increasing risk for convenience or profit. Violations 'for kicks', where rules are broken to prove machismo or to alleviate boredom. Necessary violations, where the rules prevent people from performing a necessary task. Exceptional violations, which usually are the result of extreme emotions. Age and gender are factors in the tendency to violate rules: Young men are more likely to violate rules than most older women, but men and women of all ages are similarly prone to error. These error mechanisms explain the psychological basis for errors, but the mechanisms are not readily observable. Stress [ edit ] Stress has been defined as \"the result of an imbalance between the demands placed upon an individual and the capacity of that individual to respond to the demands\". A person will respond to stress by taking actions to change the situation to reduce the stress. When the actions are successful the result is described as 'coping', when unsuccessful the level of stress will increase and may lead to panic .",

In January, the team suffered two unfortunate injuries, a broken finger and a broken collarbone, each for a beater, putting both players out of the tournament, and resulting in difficult roster implications. Luckily, a small number of Cambridge students, one of whom had previously played for Oxford, agreed to play for OUQC as well, making sure Oxford had the numbers to play. So, in February, they still managed to place first in the Southern Cup in Chigwell, going undefeated, including against Warwick after a comeback result. A flag catch from OUQC from behind put them in a closer match, yet still behind a few points. The similarity to the game they played in Southern Dev also gave Oxford a reason to be worried, but they managed to keep their heads, and the flag catch put momentum on their side. They then scored a few crucial goals, with Warwick struggling to match them, and finally the two teams were in a next-goal-wins situation. With a missed goal from each side keeping the crowd and live viewers on the edge of their seats, OUQC finally scored a winning goal, enabling them to go on to win the tournament. Having not won a tournament of this level for a few years, this felt like the year to change OUQC's fortunes and potentially have the chance to go far in the biggest tournament of the year: BQC. In the build up to BQC, there was lots of excitement at the possibility of a medal, and the team looked stronger than ever. Both of their injured players were healthy in time to come back and play so the beater side of the team looked in great shape, and the chasers had some very talented and experienced players as well as a nicely filled out roster.",

An eleventh event, the Tour of Qatar , was originally added to the calendar in October 2016, but it was cancelled in December 2016 due to lack of sponsorship support. Another new-for-2017 World Tour event, the Presidential Tour of Turkey , was postponed from its initial dates of 18–23 April, in February. In March, following a meeting of the UCI Professional Cycling Council, the race was rescheduled for 10–15 October. A new points ranking was also introduced for the 2017 season, based upon the points scales for the UCI World Ranking . Therefore, up to 60 riders – up from a maximum of 20 riders at the Grand Tours – would be able to score points in all races. As well as the new points rankings, the previous ranking by nations was also removed. Just as in 2016 , the team time trial at the UCI World Championships , scheduled to be held on 17 September, had been due to award points towards the team rankings. In August 2017, the Association International des Groupes Cyclistes Professionels ( AIGCP ) agreed a deal with the UCI to avoid a boycott of the race, but no points would be awarded towards the World Tour rankings. Final points standings [ edit ] See also: UCI World Ranking Individual [ edit ] Riders tied with the same number of points were classified by number of victories, then number of second places, third places, and so on, in World Tour events and stages. 436 riders scored points. 200 other riders finished in positions that would have earned them points, but they were ineligible as members of non- UCI WorldTeams . Team [ edit ] Team rankings were calculated by adding the ranking points of all the riders of a team in the table.",

          "text": "The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films. Awards and nominations [ edit ] La Strada won more than fifty international awards, including an Oscar in 1957 for Best Foreign Language Film, the first recipient in that category. Legacy [ edit ] \" La Strada is nothing less than a rite of passage, a vision of perennially failing pig-man. Zampanò is here , at the center of a debased culture once again: a spiritually abandoned savage, who, trudging in a circle, makes a show of breaking voluntarily assumed chains--his destiny to burrow at last in shifting sand with the tide coming in and the sky bereft of illusion, having rejected the Clown and destroyed the Fool in himself.\" Vernon Young, Hudson Review . During Fellini's early film career, he was closely associated with the movement known as neorealism , a set of films produced by the Italian film industry during the post-World War II period, particularly 1945–1952, and characterized by close attention to social context, a sense of historical immediacy, political commitment to progressive social change, and an anti-Fascist ideology. Although there were glimpses of certain lapses in neorealistic orthodoxy in some of his first films as a director, La Strada has been widely viewed as a definitive break with the ideological demands of neorealist theorists to follow a particular political slant or embody a specific \"realist\" style. This resulted in certain critics vilifying Fellini for, as they saw it, reverting to prewar attitudes of individualism, mysticism and preoccupation with \"pure style\". Fellini vigorously responded to this criticism: \"Certain people still think neorealism is fit to show only certain kinds of reality, and they insist that this is social reality. It is a program, to show only certain aspects of life\".",

Heuveldorp released Loetoeng Kasaroeng , the colony's first domestically produced film, and 1949, when the Dutch formally recognised Indonesia's sovereignty after a four-year revolution , leaving the Dutch East Indies defunct. Altogether, they are credited for 93 of all known films produced in the Indies , and four of them remained active after independence. All were men; the first female film producer in Indonesia, Ratna Asmara , produced her first film in 1953. The colony's first producer, Heuveldorp, was of European descent. He was followed in 1928 by the ethnic Chinese businessmen Tjan Tjoen Lian and Liem Goan Lian, who began work on Lily van Java but soon pulled out, to be replaced by David Wong. By 1930 Chinese producers had dominated the industry. The most active of these, The Teng Chun , made his debut in 1931 with Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang ; he would go on to produce another 27 films before independence. No native Indonesian film producers are recorded from this period, although several productions were credited only to companies. Producers in the Indies would often handle multiple roles, such as director and cinematographer. When these positions were filled separately, the producer retained creative control. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that works produced during this time were emphatically commercial, not paying attention to nationalistic or aesthetic values. However, the film scholars Thomas Barker and Charlotte Setijadi-Dunn suggest that the Chinese-produced films from the Indies offered the possibility of a heterogeneous national identity. The following list is sorted alphabetically by default, with further sorting capability in certain fields; owing to differing naming conventions between cultures, not all entries are sorted by last name.",

Recent economic liberalisation also plays a role as not everyone is equally capable of taking advantage of its benefits. Differences in opportunities and endowments tend to be based on race , ethnicity, rurality, and gender . Because inequality in gender and location are near-universal, race and ethnicity play a larger, more integral role in discriminatory practices in Latin America. The differences have a strong impact on the distribution of income, capital and political standing. One indicator of inequality is access to and quality of education. During the first phase of globalization in Latin America, educational inequality was on the rise, peaking around the end of the 19th century. In comparison with other developing regions , Latin America then had the highest level of educational inequality , which is certainly a contributing factor for its current general high inequality. During the 20th century, however, educational inequality started decreasing. Standard of living [ edit ] Latin America has the highest levels of income inequality in the world. The following table lists all the countries in Latin America indicating a valuation of the country's Human Development Index , GDP at purchasing power parity per capita, measurement of inequality through the Gini index , measurement of poverty through the Human Poverty Index , a measure of extreme poverty based on people living on less than 1.25 dollars a day, life expectancy , murder rates and a measurement of safety through the Global Peace Index .

          "text": "Real GDP per capita development in Costa Rica The economy of Costa Rica has been very stable for some years now, with continuing growth in the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and moderate inflation, though with a high unemployment rate: 11.49% in 2019. Costa Rica's economy emerged from recession in 1997 and has shown strong aggregate growth since then. The estimated GDP for 2023 is US$90 billion, up significantly from the US$52.6 billion in 2015 while the estimated 2024 per capita (purchasing power parity) is US$28,558. Inflation remained around 4% to 5% per annum for several years up to 2015 but then dropped to 0.7% in 2016; it was expected to rise to a still moderate 2.8% by the end of 2017 In 2017, Costa Rica had the highest standards of living in Central America in spite of the high poverty level. The poverty level dropped by 1.2% in 2017 to 20.5%, thanks to reducing inflation and benefits offered by the government. The estimated unemployment level in 2017 was 8.1%, roughly the same as in 2016. The country has evolved from an economy that once depended solely on agriculture , to one that is more diverse, based on tourism , electronics and medical components exports, medical manufacturing and IT services. Corporate services for foreign companies employ some 3% of the workforce. Of the GDP, 5.5% is generated by agriculture, 18.6% by industry and 75.9% by services (2016). Agriculture employs 12.9% of the labor force, industry 18.57%, services 69.02% (2016) Many foreign companies operate in the various Free-trade zones .",

She was born in England and raised in France . Her father was an influential American merchant, and she was regularly introduced to prominent Americans. After her family returned to England, she met John Quincy Adams in 1795, and the two began a tenuous courtship. They married in 1797 after being engaged for a year, beginning a marriage of disagreements and personality conflicts. She joined her husband on his diplomatic mission to Prussia , where she was popular with the Prussian court . When they returned to the United States, her husband became a senator and she gave birth to three sons. John was appointed minister to the Russian Empire in 1809, and they traveled to Russia without their two older sons, against Louisa's wishes. Though she was again popular with the court, she detested living in Russia, especially after the death of her infant daughter in 1812. She lived in Russia alone for a year while John negotiated the Treaty of Ghent , and when he asked her to join him in 1815, she made the dangerous 40-day journey across war-torn Europe. The Adamses lived in England for two years before returning to the United States when John was appointed Secretary of State . Louisa became a prominent cabinet wife and regularly hosted important guests in her home. She worked to build connections for her husband's 1824 presidential run , allowing for his victory. She was unsatisfied in the White House , where she became reclusive and grew distant from her husband. She instead took to writing, producing plays, essays, poems, and an autobiography.",

Since the early 20th century it has been administered as a Welsh county . A possible birthplace is Llanrumney , which is now in the city of Cardiff but was historically in Monmouthshire. ^ Information on the year of Morgan's birth is unreliable; in a deposition sworn in November 1671 he gave his age as 36. ^ The sources that show Robert as Henry's father include: Zahedieh, Nuala (2004). \"Morgan, Sir Henry (c.1635–1688)\".

The San Antonio side of the avenue is lined with several retail stores including Jaka Plaza, Shopwise Sucat, the Santa Grove strip mall, and Amaia Steps, a condominium with a retail podium. It is also the main access road to the different gated communities as well as a few slum areas in between those communities. The Elorde Sports Center, a popular boxing venue and the oldest in the chain of boxing gyms in the country owned by the family of Gabriel Elorde , has stood on the 3-hectare (7.4-acre) site across from the Manila Memorial Park and adjacent to Fourth Estate Subdivision on Dr. Santos Avenue since 1974. San Antonio Avenue is the main north–south thoroughfare of the barangay situated on the western side by the Jaka Plaza. This local road not only provides access to the Parañaque City Hall, the San Antonio de Padua Parish Church and San Antonio Valley Wet Market, it also serves to connect the communities of San Antonio and Don Bosco and as an alternate route between Dr. Santos Avenue and Doña Soledad Avenue , through a maze of narrow residential streets in San Antonio Valley and Better Living Subdivision. Public transportation in San Antonio consists primarily of jeepneys and UV Express along Dr. Santos Avenue and West Service Road, and city buses along South Luzon Expressway. The barangay is also served by the Sucat railway station in the adjacent barangay Sucat . Tricycles are the main mode of transportation in the gated barangays and inner streets like San Antonio Avenue in San Antonio Valley, which is typical of barangays in Metro Manila.

Founder of Refuge Erin Pizzey expressed her support to Johnny Depp, describing him as a survivor of domestic violence: \"Johnny Depp is a hero. He is a precedent setter who has done the world a great favour. From now on, every judge and jury considering allegations of abuse will know of this case. They will know that an accused man has proven his innocence, and that men are abused too. Most importantly, they will know that a violent woman was the abuser, and that women can be violent—this realisation is the trial's legacy.\" Some commentators were skeptical of the trial's long-term effect, arguing that the trial's context was too unique to be indicative of #MeToo's reversal. Mitra Ahouraian, a media attorney, said \"I'm hoping that people recognize this as distinct from a lot of the #MeToo situations that we've seen, for example, like the Harvey Weinsteins of the world.

Visual style [ edit ] Duran Duran at SXSW in Austin, Texas , 2011 From the beginning of their career, all the members had a keen sense of visual style. They worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn & Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon outgrowing the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured early New Romantic look that had been popularised by Adam Ant during 1980–81. They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with Vivienne Westwood and in the 2000s with Giorgio Armani . The band retained creative control of their visual presentation having worked closely with graphic designer Malcolm Garrett and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials. Teen and music magazines in the UK latched onto their good looks quickly, and the USA soon followed. It was a rare month in the early 1980s when there was not at least one picture of the band members in teen magazines such as Smash Hits or Tiger Beat .",

This settlement was destroyed during the Austro - Ottoman wars at the end of 17th and beginning of the 18th century. Another settlement, Hološ (also known as Velika Holuša), was a local administrative centre in the 17th century, during the Ottoman administration. This settlement was also destroyed at the end of the 17th century. According to some sources, an older settlement named Kekenj (Kekend, Keken) existed at this location. In 1423 it was mentioned as the domain of Hungarian kings, under the name of Kokenyd, and as a property of the Hungarian king Sigismund . In 1558, this settlement was populated by Serbs . It was deserted after the Banat Uprising in 1594. Modern history [ edit ] Seal of the District of Velika Kikinda Cross at the main square in Kikinda, at the beginning of the 20th century. Orthodox Church The City Square and the Catholic Church The history of modern Kikinda can be traced back for 250 years; by 1751–1752, when the area where the city is presently located began to be repopulated. The Serbs settled in two waves. The first settlers were Serbs who served in border patrols of the Habsburg military. They were tasked with protecting the borders against the Ottomans along the rivers of the Moriš and the Tisa . After the Požarevac peace treaty, where an agreement between the Habsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire was reached, the Ottomans lost the territory of Banat , which led to huge job losses among the Serb population. As a result, they founded a new settlement in an effort to make a living from agriculture .",

Louisa's father supported American independence , and the Johnsons left England in 1778 in response to the American Revolutionary War . They moved to Nantes , France, where they lived for the next five years. While in France, Louisa attended a Catholic boarding school . She performed well in school, becoming proficient in music and literature, and she learned to speak French fluently. She also practiced Catholicism. Such was her immersion in French that she was later forced to relearn English. She was also versed in Greek and Latin. The Johnsons lived in luxury, even when they did not have the financial means to do so. Their home in France was a mansion that came to be known as \"The Temple of Taste\". The Johnsons returned to England and settled in Tower Hill , while Louisa was placed in a London boarding school. She was teased for her French mannerisms, and the Catholicism that she had learned in France caused conflict with her Anglican religious education in England. Her self-esteem suffered, and she kept a distance from her peers. She was sent to be educated by John Hewlett , an Anglican minister and a family friend of the Johnsons. Hewlett became a strong influence on her upbringing, encouraging her intellectualism. The Johnsons suffered financially in 1788, and she was pulled out of school to be educated by a governess . Marriage (1790–1797) [ edit ] Portrait by Edward Savage , 1794 Johnson's father was appointed the American consul to Great Britain in 1790, and she often assisted in entertaining prominent guests.

By 1898 archaeologists had found nine wells, which required lifting water out. The lines must have been long. Each spectator would have had to bring his own jug. Roman public latrine in the thermae of Ephesus There were a few facilities that received water from the Kladeos by short aqueducts, notably the \"Greek baths,\" an open swimming pool, built over in the Roman period by the Kladeos baths. The pool was 24 m (26 yd) by 16 m (17 yd) by 1.6 m (5.2 ft) deep. Under it are the remains of a channel pointed south, presumed to have connected to the pool and the Kladeos lower down. It was presumed supplied by surface channels nearby, but not enough of them remains to trace the connections exactly, and that is true of a more extensive channel system northwest of the Phillipeion; that is, between Kronos and the Kladeos Wall. These channels date from the 5th to the 2nd centuries BC. As the elevation of the Kladeos baths is only 35 m (115 ft) and the elevation of the river at the bridge from the town to the park is 38 m (125 ft), the channels must have taken water from the north of the park, above the Kladeos Wall, and diverted it to the facilities. The location of the future Nymphaeum was higher than these mini-aqueducts and thus inaccessible to them. Whether any structures, such as a spring capture, preceded the Nymphaeum is not known. Waste water must have drained to the south toward the confluence of the Kladeos and the Alfeios.",

          "text": "The city remains mainly unexcavated. In her recent book ( Barringer, Judith M. (2021). Olympia: A Cultural History . Princeton: Princeton University Press. pp. 220– 221. ) J. Barringer, relying on earlier studies of Olympia, states \"This whole structure framed a basin into which water flowed from a 1km-long aqueduct, which came from the south along the north-south path east of the Leonidaion.\" However, the rule that water flows downhill, being a law of nature as we know it, is invariant. The Nymphaion was made the high point of the park for a reason. Olympia is on a slope of the Alfeios valley at the very foot of the hills above it. The slope is toward the Alfeios on the south; aqueducts cannot come from there unless from the hills on the other side of the valley, for which there is even less evidence. The channel taken as influent must be effluent. Adler's 1km quoted by Barringer has no meaning out of context; discounting the Alfeios itself, there are no sources 1km away except to the north, beyond the Kronos hill. In Ch. 5 Plate 1, Barringer has the real aqueduct labeled as a retaining wall, which it can't be, since there is no loose or rocky slope to retain. The wall instead is retained from toppling by metal braces. Citations [ edit ] ^ Aristodimou, Georgia (2008). \"Nymphaea in Asia Minor\" .

The objects of this liberality are as various as the needs of the community—temples, theatres, bridges, markets, a portico or a colonnade, the relaying of a road or pavement from the forum to the port, the repair of an aqueduct, above all the erection of new baths or the restoration of old ones, .... ^ One of the last presentations of the site as a grotto can be found in Elderkin, G.W.

By Adler's publication the aqueduct had been discovered, but the concept of a spring-house in a grotto still clung to it. ^ The tunnel was vaulted, 0.4 m (1.3 ft) wide, 0.72 m (2.4 ft) high. ^ The area of the water entering the cistern is more than one square foot.

Before the examination of witnesses began, Mayor Sturgis was seen conversing with Tyler and handed him a written note. After the trial began, Tyler and Moore were taken into another room, and some reports say that Sturgis went in with them. Sturgis never returned to the courtroom, but when Tyler and Moore returned, several witnesses reported that Tyler had a pistol on his side they had not seen before. The second witness to testify was James Brantley. Tyler asked Brantley to stay on the stand and reportedly said, \"I want to introduce two or three witnesses to impeach your veracity.\" Outraged, Brantley took a cane of Marshal William S. Patton and lunged toward Tyler. Patton grabbed Brantley and told him to stop, and Tyler moved toward the courtroom door. Some witnesses claimed to have seen Tyler reach into his pocket for a gun. At this moment, the first shot was fired, although the person responsible is debated. Marshal Patton said he did not see Tyler shoot, but he thought the shot came from that direction. When the first shot was fired, Tyler was in little to no danger as he was 10 feet (3.0 m) to 12 feet (3.7 m) from Brantley. Several of the people in the courtroom at the time claimed that Tyler fired first. Firearms were quickly drawn across the courtroom, and general shooting broke out. The shootout lasted somewhere between one and five minutes, and in the process, Judge Bramlette was killed, and Clopton was injured. Tyler sprinted to a second-floor veranda , hopped the railing, and jumped to the ground. The barber Jack Williams reported seeing him throw away what looked like a pistol as he jumped.",

Minor league baseball team The Wisconsin Timber Rattlers are a Minor League Baseball team of the Midwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers . They are located in Grand Chute, Wisconsin , a town on the outskirts of Appleton in the Fox Cities , and are named for the timber rattlesnake , which is more commonly found in southwest Wisconsin. The team plays their home games at Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium , which opened in 1995. They previously played at Goodland Field from their founding in 1958 until the end of the 1994 season. Originally known as the Fox Cities Foxes , the team began play in 1958 as members of the Three–I League . The circuit suspended operations after the 1961 season, so the club joined the Midwest League in 1962. They became known as the Appleton Foxes in 1967 and adopted their Wisconsin Timber Rattlers moniker in 1995. In conjunction with Major League Baseball 's reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, Wisconsin was shifted to the High-A Central, which was renamed the Midwest League in 2022. Wisconsin has served as a farm club for six Major League Baseball franchises. They have won ten league titles, including one Three–I League championship and nine Midwest League championships , most recently in 2012. History [ edit ] Prior professional baseball in Appleton [ edit ] Appleton , the largest of Wisconsin 's Fox Cities , has hosted Minor League Baseball teams since the late 19th century. The city's professional baseball history dates back to 1891 with the formation of the Appleton Papermakers in the single-season Wisconsin State League . The city was home to a new Papermakers team in the Wisconsin–Illinois League from 1909 to 1914.",

The second generation of Nihonga artists formed the Japan Fine Arts Academy ( Nihon Bijutsuin ) to compete against the government-sponsored Bunten , and although yamato-e traditions remained strong, the increasing use of western perspective , and western concepts of space and light began to blur the distinction between Nihonga and yōga . Japanese painting in the prewar Shōwa period was largely dominated by Sōtarō Yasui and Ryūzaburō Umehara , who introduced the concepts of pure art and abstract painting to the Nihonga tradition, and thus created a more interpretative version of that genre. This trend was further developed by Leonard Foujita and the Nika Society, to encompass surrealism . To promote these trends, the Independent Art Association ( Dokuritsu Bijutsu Kyokai ) was formed in 1931. During the World War II , government controls and censorship meant that only patriotic themes could be expressed. Many artists were recruited into the government propaganda effort, and critical non-emotional review of their works is only just beginning.",

Today, Singapore has four official languages, English , Malay , Mandarin , and Tamil . Malay is the ceremonial national language of the country and is the home language to 13% of the population. Although most of the younger generation of non-Malay people are non-proficient in the Malay language, Malay is used in the national anthem of Singapore and also in citations for Singapore orders and decorations and military parade drill commands. Almost all Singaporeans are bilingual since the introduction of Singapore's bilingual language education policy Singapore English , however, remains the de facto lingua franca spoken by Singaporeans today. It is the main language of instruction in all school subjects except for Mother Tongue lessons and also the common language of administration, law and business. In 2009, more than 20 languages were identified as being spoken in Singapore, reflecting a rich linguistic diversity in the city. Literature Main article: Singaporean literature Singaporean literature consists of literary works that is written in either of the 4 official languages. Although these works may be considered as literature works to their specific languages, they are also viewed as a distinct body of literature portraying various aspects of Singapore society and forms a significant part of the culture of Singapore. Singaporean literature in English was first started by the Peranakan community in colonial Singapore during the 1830s.

          "text": "ferox var. spelea , without a detailed description or holotype designation. In 1935, Gabriel Petit considered spelea to represent a distinct species, but did not assign any specimen as the holotype. Charles Lamberton reviewed the subfossil and living Cryptoprocta remains in 1939, and assigned other specimens found in different localities to C. spelea , agreeing with Petit in the recognition of two species. The generic name Cryptoprocta translates to \"hidden anus\" referring to the fact that the anus is hidden by anal sacs in C. ferox . The specific name spelea means \"cave\" and was given because of the location of its discovery. However, Lamberton apparently had at most three skeletons of the living fossa, not nearly enough to capture the range of variation in that species, and some later authors did not separate C. spelea and C. ferox as two distinct species. Steven Goodman and colleagues, using larger samples, compiled another set of Cryptoprocta measurements that was published in a 2004 article. They found that some subfossil Cryptoprocta fell outside the range of variation of living C. ferox , and identified those as representing C. spelea . Grandidier had not designated a type specimen for the species, and no material described by Grandidier that is associated with the name spelea can be located in the collections of the National Museum of Natural History, France (MNHN). To maintain C. spelea as the name for the larger form of the fossa, Goodman and colleagues proposed a well-preserved specimen MNHN CG 1977.755 to be designated as the neotype . Lamberton recognized a third species, Cryptoprocta antamba , on the basis of a mandible (lower jaw) with abnormally broad spacing between the condyloid processes at the back.",

Culture [ edit ] Main article: Latin American culture Roman Catholic Easter procession in Comayagua , Honduras Nicaraguan women wearing the Mestizaje costume, which is a traditional costume worn to dance the Mestizaje dance. The costume demonstrates the Spanish influence upon Nicaraguan clothing. Latin American culture is a mixture of many influences: Indigenous cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to European colonization. Ancient and advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The Maya, the Aztec and the Inca are examples of these. Indigenous legacies in music, dance, foods, arts and crafts, clothing, folk culture and traditions are strong in Latin America. Indigenous languages affected Spanish and Portuguese, giving rise to loanwords like pampa , taco , tamale , cacique . European cultures were brought mainly by the colonial powers – the Spanish, Portuguese and French – between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most enduring European colonial influences are language, institutions, customs and Catholicism. Additional cultural influences came from Europe during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, due to growing immigration from Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal; as well as artistic, ideological and technological developments of the time.",

          "text": "Maurice was eased out when his flamboyant policies came close to ruining the company and his final act was to sell shares to a consortium of Germans close to the Nazi party. The major holding in the paper was also sold to the Germans by Albert Lejeune, on behalf of his boss Raymond Petenôtre, who had taken refuge in the USA. L'Auto therefore fell to some extent under German control and the column of general news that Goddet had included to widen the appeal of L'Auto appeal became a propaganda tool for the occupants. The doors of L'Auto were boarded up on liberation on 17 August 1944, because it \"submitted to German control\". L'Équipe [ edit ] Goddet succeeded in launching a new paper, L'Équipe , in 1946, but a condition imposed by the reconstruction government was that Goddet's name wasn't to be associated with his paper nor his presence seen in its building. Two other publishers hoped to establish sports papers and they complained that Goddet's name was associated not only with the tarnished L'Auto but with the Tour de France, which gave L'Équipe an unfair advantage when all newspapers were supposed to have an equal chance of establishing themselves. On L'Équipe ' s first front page, Goddet wrote anonymously: We are living through a cruel time in the life of a society in which, if we fail to resist it, selfishness will become the dominant passion. Against such a threat, we will fight in the name of solidarity. Équipe [team] – the very word exercises a noble influence on the heart of our group – an influence that was exerting itself during a time of rage and hope when our collective will was placed in the service of the Resistance. Goddet was educated at a private school near Oxford , England , and maintained a love for both Britain and the enthusiasm for sport encouraged in his school.",

Sebastián Piñera (center) in the ceremony of designation of Enrique Paris (left) as minister of Health, replacing Jaime Mañalich (right). A few months before the first cases of COVID-19, Chile had a series of massive protests and riots against the government of Sebastián Piñera , known locally as el Estallido social . Although not as massive as in October or November 2019, several protests continued in 2021 in the main Chilean cities. However, most of them had to come to a halt due to pandemic and the establishment of several partial lockdowns in Santiago and other cities. The situation was initially seen as an opportunity by the Piñera government to ease the protests and change of the government's priorities, focusing on the pandemic management instead of the protests' claims; internally, some government members even called the situation, \"Saint Covid\". In the few weeks after the start of lockdowns, government agencies erased most of the street art in downtown Santiago that was drawn during the protests and Piñera visited an empty Plaza Italia —the main site of protests— to take some pictures there, which was considered by many as a way of taunting the protesters under quarantine. Once the number of COVID-19 cases started to rise in mid May 2020, the situation turned difficult for the Piñera administration. On one hand, the government had a difficult and tense relationship with scientists and healthcare professionals, especially the Chilean Medical College , who criticized the lack of transparent data, considered several measures taken as inadequate or belated, and denounced precarious and unsafe conditions for health workers. Mayors, including some of the governing political parties, openly disobeyed some measures from the government and implemented their own protection measures.",

By the early to mid twentieth century, an increasingly significant number of migrant workers chose to stay permanently, with their descendants forming the bulk of Singapore's population today. In 1957, Singapore attained self-governance and Singaporean citizenship was granted to selected residents who were born in Singapore or the Federation of Malaya , British citizens who had been resident for two years, and others who had been resident for ten years. On September 16, 1963, all Singaporeans effectively became Malaysian citizens as Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak were merged to form Malaysia. However, about two years after the merger, Singapore seceded from Malaysia on August 9, 1965, and Malaysian citizenship was withdrawn from Singaporean citizens. Singaporean nationality law was incorporated into the new Constitution of Singapore . The constitution repealed the 1957 Ordinance, and all persons who were citizens as of 16 September 1963 by virtue of the Ordinance continued to be Singaporean citizens. Today, Singaporean citizenship is granted by birth, by descent, or by registration. Although provided for in the Constitution, citizenship by naturalisation is no longer granted. The government instead uses the constitutional provision for citizenship by registration to grant citizenship to resident aliens.
