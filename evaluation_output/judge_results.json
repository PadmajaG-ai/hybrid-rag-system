Karl Ferdinand Braun invented the phased array antenna in 1905, which led to the development of radar , smart antennas and MIMO , sharing the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Guglielmo Marconi \"for their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy \". Philipp Reis constructed the first device to transmit a voice via electronic signals and for that the first modern telephone , while also coining the term. Georgius Agricola gave chemistry its modern name. He is generally referred to as the father of mineralogy and as the founder of geology as a scientific discipline, while Justus von Liebig is considered one of the principal founders of organic chemistry . Otto Hahn is the father of radiochemistry and discovered nuclear fission , the scientific and technological basis for the utilization of atomic energy . Emil Behring , Ferdinand Cohn , Paul Ehrlich , Robert Koch , Friedrich Loeffler and Rudolph Virchow were among the key figures in the creation of modern medicine , while Koch and Cohn were also founders of microbiology . Johannes Kepler was one of the founders and fathers of modern astronomy , the scientific method , natural and modern science . Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays . Albert Einstein introduced the special relativity and general relativity theories for light and gravity in 1905 and 1915 respectively. Along with Max Planck , he was instrumental in the creation of modern physics with the introduction of quantum mechanics , in which Werner Heisenberg and Max Born later made major contributions. Einstein, Planck, Heisenberg and Born all received a Nobel Prize for their scientific contributions; from the award's inauguration in 1901 until 1956, Germany led the total Nobel Prize count. Today the country is ranked third with 115 winners .",

          "text": "Winckelmann stands at an early stage of the transformation of taste in the late 18th century. Winckelmann's study Sendschreiben von den Herculanischen Entdeckungen (\"Letter about the Discoveries at Herculaneum\") was published in 1762, and two years later Nachrichten von den neuesten Herculanischen Entdeckungen (\"Report on the Latest Discoveries at Herculaneum\"). From these, scholars obtained their first real information about the excavations at Pompeii. His major work, Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums (1764, \"The History of Ancient Art\"), deeply influenced contemporary views of the superiority of Greek art. It was translated into French in 1766 and later into English and Italian. Among others, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing based many of the ideas in his Laocoön (1766) on Winckelmann's views on harmony and expression in the visual arts. In the historical portions of his writings, Winckelmann used not only the works of art he himself had studied but the scattered notices on the subject to be found in ancient writers; and his wide knowledge and active imagination enabled him to offer many fruitful suggestions as to periods about which he had little direct information. To the still existing works of art, he applied a minute empirical scrutiny. Many of his conclusions, based on inadequate evidence of Roman copies, would be modified or reversed by subsequent researchers. Nonetheless, the fervid descriptive enthusiasm of passages in his work, its strong and yet graceful style, and its vivid descriptions of works of art gave it a most immediate appeal. It marked an epoch by indicating the spirit in which the study of Greek art and of ancient civilization should be approached, and the methods by which investigators might hope to attain solid results. To Winckelmann's contemporaries it came as a revelation, and it exercised a profound influence on the best minds of the age.",

          "text": "Apart from the prominence of Turks and Turkish culture, Frashëri stressed the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Ottoman Empire in his encyclopedia. That theme was embodied in the entry Ottoman , a term Frashëri presented as originating from a great Turkish tribe but shifting in meaning over time to encompass all Ottoman peoples and subjects as a result of reforms following the principle of equality. This definition reflected the Ottomanism of the Tanzimat era. After being involved with the Albanian movement during the League of Prizren period Frashëri increasingly came under suspicion by the Ottoman government over a number of times. In an investigation of 1890 into Frashëri by authorities, an acquaintance said that he and his brothers worked for eventual Albanian independence by first aiming to unite the Albanian inhabited vilayets into a unitary province within the empire. Ottoman authorities did not act against him and he published a further four volumes of his encyclopedia with the last being in 1899 while continuing with public and private discourses on Albania and Albanians. In 1896, the authors of the Ottoman government provincial almanac for Kosovo titled Kosova Salnamesi credited Frashëri and his encyclopedia as the source for most of their information. By 1899, a successor organisation to the Prizren League called League of Peja (Besa-Besë) had arisen and Frashëri again attempted to raise public discussion on Albania. He organised an Albanian Committee in Istanbul that supported lower taxes and use of Albanian in government schools in the region. These events saw his position with the state change rapidly and according to recollections by his children in later years a palace official had visited Frashëri at his home and restricted his movements while he was still employed by the government until his death.",

          "text": "The true reason was the refusal of Sultan Mahmud II to hand over Syria according to agreement. For ten years from this date the relations of sultan and pasha remained in the forefront of the questions which agitated the diplomatic world. It was not only the very existence of the Ottoman Empire that seemed to be at stake, but Egypt itself had become more than ever an object of attention, to British statesmen especially, and in the issue of the struggle were involved the interests of the British Empire in the two routes to India by the Isthmus of Suez and the valley of the Euphrates . Ibrahim, who once more commanded in his father's name, launched another brilliant campaign beginning with the storming of Acre on 27 May 1832, and culminating in the rout and capture of Reşid Mehmed Pasha at Konya on 22 December. Soon after he was blocked by the intervention of Russia , however. As the result of endless discussions between the representatives of the powers, the Porte and the pasha, the Convention of Kütahya was signed on 14 May 1833, by which the sultan agreed to bestow on Muhammad Ali the pashaliks of Syria, Damascus , Aleppo and Itcheli, together with the district of Adana . Muhammad Ali now ruled over a virtually independent empire, subject only to a moderate tribute, stretching from the Sudan to the Taurus Mountains . However the unsound foundations of his authority were not long in revealing themselves. Scarcely a year from the signing of the Convention of Kütahya the application by Ibrahim of Egyptian methods of government, notably of the monopolies and conscription, had driven Syrian Druze and Sunni Arabs, who had welcomed him as a deliverer, into revolt .",

As the three co-chairs observed in their introduction to the GRI report: \"The time has come for a new stakeholder paradigm of international governance analogous to that embodied in the stakeholder theory of corporate governance on which the World Economic Forum itself was founded.\" Intergovernmental bodies in the UN system [ edit ] The United Nations effort to develop multistakeholder governance is widely regarded to have started with the 1992 U.N. Conference on Environment and Development (more commonly known at the Rio Conference ). There, governments created nine major non-state groups which could be part of the official intergovernmental process. Ten years later in Johannesburg the follow-up conference created a new multistakeholder implementation process called officially \"type II conference outcomes,\" where transnational corporations, NGOs, and governments pledged to work together to implement a specific section of the conference report. A separate government effort to define multistakeholder governance has been a series of United Nations General Assembly resolutions on 'partnerships'. The earliest resolution (2002) drew \"the attention of Member States to multi-stakeholder initiatives, in particular, the Global Compact Initiative of the Secretary-General, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations , the multi-stakeholder dialogue process of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Information and Communication Technologies Task Force \". Over the next 17 years until 2019, the governments at the United Nations continued to evolve their understanding of multistakeholder governance by adopting eight other related resolutions. In the most recent partnership resolution from 2019, governments identified a number of principles that should define a multistakeholder partnership.",

Neon Genesis Evangelion was the only non-I.G studio's work that Ing invested in, and Ishikawa said that investing in this blockbuster work turned out to be a very good result for the studio. Production I.G produced the film Ghost in the Shell , which was released in Japan in 1995. When this video was released in the U.S., it was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. Billboard magazine 's Sell Video category in 1996, and the studio became known as one of the top animation studios in the world, both in name and reality. The film would go on to spawn a Ghost in the Shell franchise that includes sequel and reboot films, television series, original video animation, and original net animation. Ishikawa says this work was the biggest turning point for the studio. In Japanese anime production, manufacturers which are involved in the manufacturing, sale and distribution of video software , television stations , publishers and advertising agencies form a production committee, and animation studios generally join after the committee is formed. Since this would not be profitable enough for the studio, Ishikawa decided that the studio needed to move from being the one who was given permission to produce works to being the one who had the right to grant permission. He approached Kodansha , the publisher of the original Ghost in the Shell manga, and obtained permission to produce three forms of production: an anime TV series, a movie, and a video game. Since Production I.G has a direct contract with Kodansha for the rights to produce anime adaptations from the original manga, it is able to take the initiative when forming the production committee, including the ability to issue usage licenses to each of the participating companies.",

          "text": "Small lizards, frogs, snails, and slugs are also eaten, as are crabs from the genus Potamon , fruits , flower buds, mosses , and leaves . Fish have also been identified as a prey item in Nigeria. At at least one nesting site, it relies heavily on the arthropods feeding on the bat guano near the cave for sustenance, while this behaviour has been reported to a lesser extent at other sites. It is known to regurgitate what it has eaten in pellet form. Overall, between 52 and 60 percent of the bird's diet is believed to be composed of animals. Rove beetle larvae and ants were the most frequently eaten prey in a study in Nigeria. Reproduction [ edit ] The grey-necked rockfowl breeds either alone or in small colonies averaging two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site. It is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate. It is believed to breed cooperatively in Equatorial Guinea, as four different birds were observed feeding one nest. The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown. The timing of the egg laying in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony. It has been suggested that this is to promote cooperative breeding. The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with a few weeks before the onset of the wet season; in areas where the wet season is bimodal, two different breeding seasons occur. However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent mists of the wet season.",

          "text": "Political independence from European monarchies did not result in the abolition of black slavery in the new nations, and it resulted in political and economic instability in Spanish America immediately after independence. Yet, as regional Caudillos started to rise in power, nation-builders started to view themselves as more modern than their former European colonizers. Leaders began to shift away from aristocracy toward republicanism and democracy, which allowed all citizens, not just the Creole elites, to have a voice in politics. This shift helped unify many of the Latin American nations as all people, even illiterate people, would gather in their communities to talk about political ideals and how they should be used in their nation. Great Britain and the United States exercised significant influence in the post-independence era, resulting in a form of neo-colonialism , where political sovereignty remained in place, but foreign powers exercised considerable power in the economic sphere. Newly independent nations faced domestic and interstate conflicts, struggling with economic instability and social inequality. The 20th century brought U.S. intervention and the Cold War 's impact on the region, with revolutions in countries like Cuba influencing Latin American politics. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw shifts towards left-wing governments, followed by conservative resurgences, and a recent resurgence of left-wing politics in several countries. After 2000 [ edit ] UNASUR summit in the Palacio de la Moneda, Santiago de Chile In many countries in the early 2000s, left-wing political parties rose to power, known as the Pink tide .",

          "text": "However, Winckelmann was no theologian; he had become interested in Greek classics in his youth, but soon realized that the teachers in Halle could not satisfy his intellectual interests in this field. He nonetheless devoted himself privately to Greek and followed the lectures of Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten , who coined the term \" aesthetics \". During this period, he became an enthusiastic translator of Herodotus . With the intention of becoming a physician, in 1740 Winckelmann attended medical classes at Jena . He also taught languages. From 1743 to 1748, he was the deputy headmaster of the gymnasium of Seehausen in the Altmark but Winckelmann felt that work with children was not his true calling. Moreover, his means were insufficient: his salary was so low that he had to rely on his students' parents for free meals. He was thus obliged to accept a tutorship near Magdeburg . Whilst working as a tutor for the powerful Lamprecht family, he fell into unrequited love with the handsome Lamprecht son. This was one of a series of such loves throughout his life. His enthusiasm for the male form excited Winckelmann's budding admiration of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. Count von Bünau's librarian [ edit ] In 1748, Winckelmann wrote to Count Heinrich von Bünau : \"[L]ittle value is set on Greek literature, to which I have devoted myself so far as I could penetrate, when good books are so scarce and expensive\". In the same year, Winckelmann was appointed secretary of von Bünau's library at Nöthnitz, near Dresden . The library contained some 40,000 volumes.",

Johann Joachim Winckelmann by Ferdinand Pettrich , 1866, Albertinum , Dresden Johann Joachim Winckelmann by Friedrich Wilhelm Doell 1778, Museum of Old Masters, Dresden Johann Joachim Winckelmann ( US : / ˈ v ɪ ŋ k əl m ɑː n / VINK -əl-mahn ; German: [ˈjoːhan ˈjoːaxɪm ˈvɪŋkl̩man] ; 9 December 1717 – 8 June 1768) was a German art historian and archaeologist . He was a pioneering Hellenist who first articulated the differences between Greek , Greco-Roman and Roman art . \"The prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology \", Winckelmann was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the history of art . Many consider him the father of the discipline of art history . He was one of the first to separate Greek art into periods and time classifications. He had a decisive influence on the rise of the Neoclassical movement during the late 18th century. His writings influenced not only a new science of archaeology and art history but Western painting, sculpture, literature and even philosophy. Winckelmann's History of Ancient Art (1764) was one of the first books written in German to become a classic of European literature.",

On his way back, he was murdered in Trieste on 8 June 1768 in a hotel bed by a fellow traveller, a man named Francesco Arcangeli . The true reason for the murder is not known. One hypothesis argues that the medals given to Winckelmann by the Empress Maria Theresa were the motive, but they were not stolen after the crime. Another possibility is that Arcangeli killed Winckelmann over homosexual advances, although Winckelmann had thought that Arcangeli was only \" un uomo di poco conto \" (\"a man of little account\"). Arcangeli was executed a month later by breaking on the wheel outside the hotel in which both had been staying. Winckelmann was buried in the churchyard of Trieste Cathedral . Domenico Rossetti De Scander [ it ] and Cesare Pagnini [ it ] documented the last week of Winckelmann's life; Heinrich Alexander Stoll translated the Italian document, the so-called \"Mordakte Winckelmann\", into German. Critical response and influence [ edit ] Winckelmann's writings are key to understanding the modern European discovery of ancient (sometimes idealized) Greece, neoclassicism , and the doctrine of art as imitation ( Nachahmung ). The mimetic character of art that imitates but does not simply copy, as Winckelmann restated it, is central to any interpretation of Enlightenment classical idealism. Winckelmann stands at an early stage of the transformation of taste in the late 18th century.",

However, due to the instability of penicillin and the war-time restrictions placed on Howard Florey's Laboratory , only a small quantity of penicillin had been extracted and, although Florey and colleagues extracted any remaining penicillin from Alexander's urine, by the fifth day they had run out. Without the supply of penicillin to continue treatment, Constable Alexander relapsed and died on 15 March 1941. Florey and his team decided to work only on sick children who did not need such large amounts of penicillin, until their methods of production improved. This was not a trivial challenge: penicillin production varied widely depending on the conditions in which it was grown. During World War II, several American companies tried to scale up production. In the words of Pfizer executive John Smith, \"The mold is as temperamental as an opera singer, the yields are low, the isolation murder, the purification invites disaster.\" Nonetheless, by March 15, 1945, supplies of penicillin were not only available to American troops, but to the American public, as war-time restrictions on availability were lifted.

Yeshe Tsogyal became a great master with many disciples and is widely considered to be a female Buddha. Padmasambhava hid numerous termas in Tibet for later discovery with her aid, while she compiled and elicited Padmasambhava's teachings through the posing of questions, and then reached Buddhahood in her lifetime. Many thangkas and paintings depict Padmasambhava with consorts at each side, Mandarava on his right and Yeshe Tsogyal on his left. Many of the Nyingma school's terma texts are said to have originated from the activities of Padmasambhava and his students. These hidden treasure texts are believed to be discovered and disseminated when conditions are ripe for their reception. The Nyingma school traces its lineage of Dzogchen teachings to Garab Dorje through Padmasambhava's termas. In The Copper Palace, after the death of Trisong Detsen, Padmasambhava is said to have travelled to Lanka in order to convert its blood thirsty raksasa demons to the Dharma.

Turkish historians generally do not accept that this work belongs to Şemseddin Sami and consider the event as an effort to gain prestige to Albanian nationalism by using Şemseddin Sami's reputation and prestige. Considering Şemseddin Sami's intense interest in the issues of Turkishness and Ottomanism, especially in his last years, it can be thought that there is some truth in this view. On the other hand, in Albanian works, there is not the slightest doubt that the Albanian manifesto belongs to Şemseddin Sâmi. The booklet was smuggled out of the Ottoman Empire and published in Bucharest with the identity of the author not appearing in the publication. Publishers from Austro-Hungary printed some of Frashëri's most important works containing nationalist themes with Austro-Hungarian Albanologists Theodor Anton Ippen and Baron Nopcsa financing the translation and distribution of his publications.",

It would linger in a city for a period of forty days, and after this period, it would move on. And anyone who went from a city where the epidemic had visited, he would pass-on [the disease] unto [other] people, and the people of the other city would die, and anyone who took away anything of the precious objects of the dead, he too died. Those remaining of the people became [like] kings over the city while those who had been downtrodden became rulers and those who had been poor became rich. Midrash ha-Ḥefetz [ edit ] Midrash ha-Ḥefetz , also spelt Midrash ha-Hefez , is unique among Hebrew midrashic literature, as it is not only a collection of biblical homiletic expositions , but is a commentary on difficult phrases and words of the Torah . Many of these difficult words and expressions have been collected and arranged in a separate volume of Indices, published by the editor. Midrash ha-Ḥefetz also incorporates philosophical notions derived from Greek and Arab philosophers, where they were thought to be in agreement with the teachings of Israel's sages. Philosophical ideas drawn from Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed are also employed in his work. In this work, Zechariah ha-Rofé also expounds on the meaning of the accompanying verses of the Haftara , in its several sections. Many of the hermeneutical principles used by the Sages of Israel in biblical exegesis are explained in the prologue of Midrash ha-Ḥefetz . In some cases, Zechariah ha-Rofé deviates from the conventional explanation of biblical verses and offers novel explanations of his own.",

Rule changes [ edit ] The rules for the registration of non-EU (or non- EFTA or Swiss) nationals transferred from abroad were revised in the summer of 2010 and announced on 2 July 2010. Clubs could only sign one (rather than two previously) non-EU player and that player could only be signed if a current member of the squad who was not an EU national had been sold or sold abroad. The late announcement of this rule change meant that some clubs had to cancel incoming transfers. Parma , for example, were to sign both Colombian Pablo Armero from Brazilian side Palmeiras , who subsequently signed for Udinese instead, and Brazilian agency player Zé Eduardo , but had to choose between them and eventually transferred the latter. Their outgoing transfer was Julio César de León , who moved to Chinese team Shandong Luneng Taishan . Teams [ edit ] The league featured 17 teams returning from the 2009–10 Serie A , plus three teams promoted from 2009–10 Serie B (two as direct promotions, one as playoff winners). On 30 May 2010, Lecce and Cesena won direct promotion to the Serie A by finishing first and second, respectively. Brescia became the third Serie B team promoted on 13 June 2010 by winning the promotion playoff final 2–1 on aggregate over Torino . It was a quick turn-around for Lecce, which spent only one year in Serie B after being relegated from the 2008–09 Serie A . Cesena last played in Serie A in 1990–91 , while Brescia played five seasons in Serie B after being relegated from A in 2004–05 .",

Ukraine's human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denysova , and U.N. ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya , stated at that time that more than 120,000 children had been deported to Russia. By 26 May, more than 238,000 Ukrainian children were reported to have been deported to Russian territory. Ukraine raised the issue at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in early June, where the head of Ukraine's mission, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, quoted a message from a Ukrainian child who had been forcibly adopted despite having close living relations; addressed to his aunt, it read, in part, \"They say I'm an orphan. But I'm not an orphan, I have you, I have grandparents. There are so many children like me here. They say they want to leave us in Russia. And I don't want to stay in Russia!\" According to Ukrainska Pravda , Russia has taken 267 orphans from Mariupol to Rostov to be made Russian citizens, supervised by Maria Lvova-Belova . It also reported that Russian authorities had looked for and collected orphaned children, to be taken to an unknown destination. Sky News released CCTV footage dated June 2022 of Russian FSB officials entering an orphanage Kherson to search for orphans. Aware of the risk of child abductions, the staff hid the children prior to their arrival. Finding the orphanage empty, the FSB agents seized records, computers, and the CCTV system from the orphanage in an apparent effort to track down the missing children. Russian authorities subsequently sent abducted 15 children to be housed in the orphanage, only to be taken away by the Russian occupiers as they retreated from Kherson.",

This continued the format put in place since the 1904 season (except for 1919 ) and would be used until 1961 in the American League and 1962 in the National League. Opening Day took place on April 15, featuring 12 teams. The final day of the scheduled regular season was on September 28, which saw all sixteen teams play, continuing the trend from 1946 . The World Series took place between October 1 and October 7. Rule changes [ edit ] The 1952 season saw the following rule changes: The Open Classification level was created specifically for the Pacific Coast League (PCL), a level of play between Triple-A and major-league (this level of play would be eliminated following the PCL's reversion to Triple-A in 1958 ). Unlike other levels of the minor league, having an Open Classification came with the following stipulations: Players at the Open Classification would be excluded from the draft if they waived their selection rights or had less than five years of service. The draft price for an Open Classification player would be $15,000 (equivalent to $178,000 in 2024) instead of the $10,000 (equivalent to $118,000 in 2024) price tag on Triple-A players. To achieve Open Classification, a league had to show an aggregate population of 10 million, have an aggregate park capacity of 120,000, and average a paid attendance of 2,250,000 for the preceding five years. An 11-step process was established for a league to reach major-league status: Any group of eight teams mutually agreeing to all requirements and responsibilities as provided under the proposed regulations must apply to the major-league Executive Council. The eight teams are responsible for all necessary territorial indemnities and financial obligations.",

Prince Andor, second son, is an indulgent man, unable to discover his place. Prince Vilmos, third son, is a giant, such as are occasionally born into the line of Fenarr. The youngest, Prince Miklos, is at the center of the story. The family makes their home in a four-hundred-year-old palace, which is crumbling away under their feet. The story concerns the destruction of their crumbling home, which serves as fulcrum around which many themes revolve. Desperation at things' ending, joy at new beginnings, and the way in which we choose to separate the two, are central themes of the novel. Devera [ edit ] The character of Devera is a nine-year-old girl with brown hair, who frequently inhabits Steven Brust 's novels. In Brokedown Palace , she appears twice to Prince Miklos, both times to guide him in what must be done. Reception [ edit ] Orson Scott Card reviewed the novel favorably, praising \"the flow of Brust's language\" and concluding that Brokedown Palace is \"Traditional, but never, not for a moment, ordinary.\" References [ edit ] ^ ISFDB bibliography ^ \"The Light Fantastic\", If , September 1986, pp.26-27 Retrieved from \" \"",

As a result, these results often feature prominently in conservative libertarian justifications of unregulated markets. Two examples [ edit ] Sen's original example [ edit ] Sen's original example used a simple society with only two people and only one social issue to consider. The two members of society are named \"Lewd\" and \"Prude\". In this society there is a copy of a Lady Chatterley's Lover and it must be given either to Lewd to read, to Prude to read, or disposed of - unread. Suppose that Lewd enjoys this sort of reading and would prefer to read it rather than have it disposed of. However, they would get even more enjoyment out of Prude being forced to read it. Prude thinks that the book is indecent and that it should be disposed of, unread. However, if someone must read it, Prude would prefer to read it rather than Lewd since Prude thinks it would be even worse for someone to read and enjoy the book rather than read it in disgust. Given these preferences of the two individuals in the society, a social planner must decide what to do. Should the planner force Lewd to read the book, force Prude to read the book or let it go unread? More particularly, the social planner must rank all three possible outcomes in terms of their social desirability. The social planner decides that they should be committed to individual rights, each individual should get to choose whether they, themself will read the book.",

          "text": "Bob similarly hates Alice, and would gladly endure a yellow house if that meant that Alice would live in a red house. If each individual is free to choose their own house color, independently of the other, Alice would choose a blue house and Bob would choose a green one. But, this outcome is not Pareto efficient, because both Alice and Bob would prefer the outcome where Alice's house is red and Bob's is yellow. As a result, giving each individual the freedom to choose their own house color has led to an inefficient outcome—one that is inferior to another outcome where neither is free to choose their own color. Mathematically, we can represent Alice's preferences with this symbol: ≻ A {\\displaystyle \\succ _{A}} and Bob's preferences with this one: ≻ B {\\displaystyle \\succ _{B}} . We can represent each outcome as a pair: ( Color of Alice's house , Color of Bob's house ). As stated Alice's preferences are: (Blue, Yellow) ≻ A {\\displaystyle \\succ _{A}} (Red, Yellow) ≻ A {\\displaystyle \\succ _{A}} (Blue, Green) ≻ A {\\displaystyle \\succ _{A}} (Red, Green) And Bob's are: (Red, Green) ≻ B {\\displaystyle \\succ _{B}} (Red, Yellow) ≻ B {\\displaystyle \\succ _{B}} (Blue, Green) ≻ B {\\displaystyle \\succ _{B}} (Blue, Yellow) If we allow free and independent choices of both parties we end up with the outcome (Blue, Green) which is dispreferred by both parties to the outcome (Red, Yellow) and is therefore not Pareto efficient.

Further studies in animal models suggest that the 12 S -HETE made by pancreatic beta cells (or possibly alpha cells or other cell types indigenous to or invading the pancreatic islands) orchestrate a local immune response that results in the injury and, when extreme, death of beta cells.

          "text": "Private transporters during this time also contracted KCR staff and by 1994 KCR was in incurring major losses due to mismanagement. As a result, the vast majority of trains were discontinued with only a few running on the loop. Unable to withstand the pressures of a growing transport mafia, Pakistan Railways abandoned the KCR in 1999. The official reason for the discontinuation was that Pakistan Railways was said to be making a loss by running the trains all over the city with few passengers taking advantage of the facility. Another version suggests that private transporters conspired with some corrupt staffers in the railways to fulfill their desire to bag the bulk of passengers for themselves The result caused instant gridlock on Karachi's streets. Severe criticisms were lodged at Pakistan Railways mismanagement as well as Karachi's \"road transport mafia\". In 2005, revival plans for the KCR were initiated to fulfill the growing transportation needs of Karachi, but never fully materialized. In 2009, the Karachi Urban Transport Corporation was proposed in which KCR would be operated as a semi-autonomous body. Pakistan Railways would have 60% share in the corporation, Sindh government 25% and Karachi 15%. Route [ edit ] The KCR will consist of a loop line from Karachi City to Drigh Road via Liaquatabad . 44 kilometres (27.3 miles) will be revived with an additional 6 kilometre elevated dual track from Karachi City to Jinnah International Airport , allowing the KCR to connect to the Pakistan Railway main line. Existing railway tracks and 30 stations would be completely rebuilt on bridges. KCR would be used by 500,000 passengers/day which would increase to 1 million in later years. KCR will have 250 modern driverless electric bullet trains which would run 17-hours a day & 7-days a week. This project is also part of CPEC.",

The 850 passengers on the train disembarked and SMRT staff guided the passengers to Clementi station. To return to Ulu Pandan Depot , it had to switchover at Queenstown station . Near Dover station , a defective axle box dropped on the tracks, causing the bogie frame to be dislodged from the third car of the six-car train. The bogie damaged the third rail (exposing its cables), power cables, point machines (which enabled trains to change tracks), and rail fasteners as well as causing rail breaks across 2.55 km (1.58 mi) of track, triggering a power trip at 9:25am, which stalled the train. This also stalled four other trains between Clementi and Buona Vista, including a train 40 metres (130 ft) from Clementi station. The affected passengers from that stalled train also disembarked and walked to Clementi station with SMRT staff guidance. The train operator, SMRT Trains, first reported the incident at 9:52 am and suspended train services between the Queenstown and Boon Lay stations. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) later announced at 2:45 pm that there would not be train services between Boon Lay and Queenstown for the rest of that day because of the extensive damage. Repair and mitigation works [ edit ] Police officers and other staff managing the crowd for bus bridging services at a bus stop near Buona Vista station Engineers on the EWL tracks between Clementi and Ulu Pandan Depot The disruption caused \"extensive damage\" to the affected track stretch.

          "text": "American dramatist Susan Keating Glaspell (July 1, 1876 – July 28, 1948) was an American playwright, novelist, journalist and actress. With her husband George Cram Cook , she founded the Provincetown Players , the first modern American theatre company. First known for her short stories (fifty were published), Glaspell also wrote nine novels, fifteen plays, and a biography. Often set in her native Midwest , these semi-autobiographical tales typically explore contemporary social issues, such as gender, ethics, and dissent, while featuring deep, sympathetic characters who make principled stands. Her 1930 play Alison's House earned her the Pulitzer Prize for Drama . After her husband's death in Greece, she returned to the United States. During the Great Depression , Glaspell worked in Chicago for the Works Progress Administration , where she was Midwest Bureau Director of the Federal Theater Project . Although a best-selling author in her own time, after her death Glaspell attracted less interest and her books went out of print. She was also noted for discovering playwright Eugene O'Neill . Since the late 20th century, critical reassessment of women's contributions has led to renewed interest in her career and a revival of her reputation. In the early 21st century, Glaspell is today recognized as a pioneering feminist writer and America's first important modern female playwright. Her one-act play Trifles (1916) is frequently cited as one of the greatest works of American theatre. According to Britain's leading theatre critic, Michael Billington , she remains \"American drama's best-kept secret.\" Biography [ edit ] Early life and career [ edit ] Susan Glaspell was born in Iowa in 1876 to Elmer Glaspell, a hay farmer, and his wife Alice Keating, a public school teacher. She had an older brother, Raymond, and a younger brother, Frank.",

Involvement in the Albanian national movement [ edit ] The Besa yahut Ahde Vefa play [ edit ] In Istanbul 1874 Frashëri wrote a play named Besâ yâhut Âhde Vefâ (Pledge of Honor or Loyalty to an Oath) in the Albanian language with themes based on an Albanian ethnicity, a bond to an ethnic based territory, ethno-cultural diversity as underlying Ottoman unity, honor, loyalty and self-sacrifice. The play revolved around a betrothed girl kidnapped by a jealous villager that kills her father and whose mother vows revenge co-opting the culprit's father who gives his besa (pledge of honor) to help not knowing its his son, later killing him and himself ending with family reconciliation. Frashëri's reasons for the play were to inform people about the morals, values, customs and traditions of Albanians whom he considered an important part of the empire and to create more local Ottoman theatre which he felt was dominated by foreign influences. The play was intended to present Albanians in a positive light to Ottoman and Albanian audiences that involved mainly Armenians directing and acting in roles with smaller numbers of Turks during its stage run. His play and its discussion of besa signified to more astute audiences the political implications of the concept and possible subversive connotations in future usage while it assisted Albanians in rallying militarily and politically around a national program.",

          "text": "With major achievements in drama, novel, and short fiction, Glaspell is often cited as a \"prime example\" of an overlooked female writer deserving canonization . Perhaps the originator of modern American theater, Glaspell has been called \"the First Lady of American Drama\" and \"the Mother of American Drama.\" In 2003, the International Susan Glaspell Society was founded, with the aim of promoting \"the recognition of Susan Glaspell as a major American dramatist and fiction writer.\" Her plays are frequently performed by college and university theatre departments, but she has become more widely known for her often-anthologized works: the one-act play Trifles , and its short-story adaptation, \"A Jury of Her Peers\". Since the late 20th century, these two pieces have become staples of theatre and Women's Studies curricula across the United States and the world. Recent productions [ edit ] In 1996, the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, London , began a long association with the plays of Susan Glaspell. Auriol Smith directed The Verge in 1996, one of the first of many plays by the American playwright to be performed at the theatre. The Mint Theater in New York City produced Alison's House in 1999 under the direction of Linda Ames Key. The Metropolitan Playhouse , a New York resident theater dedicated to exploring and re-vitalizing American literature and culture, staged Inheritors in 2005; the production was directed by Yvonne Opffer Conybeare . In his 2008 programmed note for Inheritors , Orange Tree director Sam Walters wrote: In 1996... I felt we had rediscovered a really important writer. Now, whenever I talk to American students, which I do quite often, I try my 'Glaspell test'. I simply ask them if they have heard of her, and almost always none of them have.",

During the night of the shootings, three other blacks were arrested and taken to the courthouse. The next morning, they were found dead. By the time federal troops arrived several days later, about thirty black people had been killed. Many of the fatalities from the riot were buried in McLemore Cemetery . Aftermath [ edit ] During the riot, Mayor Sturgis hid in the attic of a boarding house (owned by his brother Theodore. ) He did not emerge until reaching agreement that he could resign and leave town. The day after the riot, men approached and ordered him to return to the North. He agreed to leave that night on a northbound train at midnight; he was escorted safely to the train by a group of about 300 white men. Upon reaching New York City , he wrote an account of the events in a letter to the New York Daily Tribune : They were all armed with double-barreled shot guns, and, as I was told, 200 in number, Many good citizens of Meridian plead for me, as well as many in the Ku-Klux columns who were in them not from choice, but from necessity.

The protesters, mainly men from the Qayfah tribe, agreed to reopen the road by the next day as the government agreed to negotiate with the victims. Upon the agreement, the victims were taken for burial at their villages by dozens of tribesmen. Hooria Mashhour , Yemen's Minister of Human Rights, condemned the strike and wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post criticizing US reliance on drones to fight AQAP. Mashhour argued that, by traumatizing the general population through civilian deaths, drone strikes such as the one in Radda inadvertently help AQAP recruit disgruntled Yemenis. She also criticized President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi 's endorsement of drones, writing: \"no leader can legitimately approve the extrajudicial killing of his own citizens.\" Several United Nations officials voiced criticism over the strike, and urged compensation for the victims. Christof Heyns , the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions, suggested that the strike was a violation of international humanitarian law and questioned the targeting process of US forces. Juan E. Mendez , the UN expert on torture, called the strike illegitimate and said it amounted to \"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\" of civilians.",

Within a week, more than 300 villagers had fled, fearing the presence of soldiers and a repeat of the Ngarbuh massacre. Four days later, Cameroonian soldiers killed four unarmed men in Buea. Another person was killed by soldiers in Mbiame . Towards the end of the month, separatists drew condemnation from Human Rights Watch for abducting and maltreating a humanitarian worker and members of a non-profit organization. All were eventually released. On 1 June, at least five Cameroonian soldiers were killed in a separatist ambush in Otu, Manyu . An unspecified number of soldiers were also wounded in the ambush. The next day, it was reported that Pidgin journalist Samuel Wazizi, who had been arrested on 3 August 2019 over alleged ties with separatists, had died at a military hospital after being tortured by Cameroonian soldiers. Cameroonian authorities confirmed Wazizi's death three days after the initial reports, reiterated the original accusation against Wazizi, and attributed his death to \"severe sepsis \".

          "text": "Biennial world amateur team golf championship The Espirito Santo Trophy (World Women's Amateur Team Championships) is a biennial world amateur team golf championship for women organised by the International Golf Federation . The inaugural event was held in 1964. It was instituted by the French Golf Federation in an agreement with the United States Golf Association . It was planned by Lally Segard , at the time known as Vicomtesse de Saint Sauveur, from France and Mrs. Henri Prunaret from America. Segard also asked her friends Ricardo and Silvia Espirito Santo, from Portugal , to donate a trophy for the event, which they did. They had originally bought the golden cup, which had belonged to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia , for an international Portuguese event that was not played anymore. The championship was held under the chairmanship of Segard at Golf de Saint Germain outside Paris, France . The week after, the World Amateur Golf Council agreed to manage and sponsor the tournament, beginning in 1966, to be played every second year, and Segard was appointed chairperson of the women's committee of the council. The Council changed its name to the International Golf Federation in 2003. Later tournaments have featured teams from around 50 ccountries. From 2023, the field has been restricted to 36 teams, qualified through different criteria. It is a stroke play event, in which the best two individual scores in each team count towards the final score. For the first three decades, the championship was dominated by the United States. Later results have reflected the increasing globalisation of women's golf, with six different winners in six events from 1996 to 2006, and several top two placings by teams from Asia . South Korea won four times from 1996 to 2016. The equivalent \"World Amateur Team Championship\" for men is the Eisenhower Trophy .",

Among primary school age children (ages 6 to 12), attendance is almost universal; however there is still a need to enroll five million more children in the primary education system. These children mostly live in remote areas, are Indigenous or Afro-descendants and live in extreme poverty. Among people between the ages of 13 and 17 years, only 80% are full-time students, and only 66% of these advance to secondary school. These percentages are lower among vulnerable population groups: only 75% of the poorest youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years attend school. Tertiary education has the lowest coverage, with only 70% of people between the ages of 18 and 25 years outside of the education system. Currently, more than half of low income or rural children fail to complete nine years of education.

It is believed that some special force soldiers may be aboard the ship, although their purpose was unknown. On 4 April, Italy recognized the National Transitional Council and reportedly dismissed an envoy from Gaddafi. \"Tripoli's regime has no future,\" Frattini told reporters. Latvia – The government recognized the National Transitional Council as \"the political interlocutor of Libya\" on 20 June. Luxembourg – Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said he is \"not afraid\" of \"a dictator who shoots at his own people.\" Luxembourg sits on the Libya Contact Group and recognized the National Transitional Council on 13 July. Macedonia – The government called for a \"peaceful and sustainable solution\" to the political crisis in the country. Malta – On 21 February, Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi said that the government of Malta was closely watching the events and condemned all forms of violence and bloodshed. Gonzi said the evolving situation was discussed at a cabinet meeting and Malta hoped that the best would come out of this situation for Libya and the region. He added that Libya's territorial integrity was respected. On 27 March, President George Abela expressed optimism that the revolutionary wave in North Africa, including the uprising in Libya, would reduce the amount of illegal immigration to Malta and Southern European countries. \"This wave of democratisation should give the people [of North Africa] a future in their own countries,\" said Abela.",

          "text": "Westinghouse viewed this as part of the dignity of man and part of his intellectual property. Westinghouse, unlike Edison, did not put his name on all company patents as co-inventor. Westinghouse was not in favor of labor unionization. He did not reject workers who belonged to a union, but he did not like collective bargaining arrangements where his workers might strike for issues not related to conditions at his own factories. There was only one strike at any Westinghouse company while he was in charge. It was a 1903 action at Westinghouse Machine Company, which was rushing to illuminate the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair . Westinghouse responded by immediately hiring replacements for those employees who walked out. Despite that action, American labor and union organizer Samuel Gompers is reputed to have said \"If all employers of men treated their employees with the same consideration he does, the American Federation of Labor would have to go out of existence\". A series of short movies showing conditions in and around Westinghouse factories was made in 1904 and exhibited at the St. Louis World's Fair.

He suggested weapons be sent to the rebels to assist the, and said \"Our Islamic nation should stand against injustice and corruption and I urge the Egyptian government to extend a helping hand to Libyan people and not to Gaddafi.\" He subsequently issued a fatwa that any Libyan soldier who can shoot Gaddafi should do so \"to rid Libya of him.\" A French MEP and president of the Front National , Marine Le Pen claimed that the confrontations in Libya pertain to a civil war in which France's interest is not to interfere. She regretted the haste of the French diplomacy which had \"prematurely recognized the National Transitional Council which speaks in the name of the Libyan rebels\". United States Senator John McCain , a former presidential candidate, said the U.S. and other states should recognize the National Transitional Council while on a visit to Benghazi in late April. \"[The rebels] have earned this right and Gaddafi has forfeited it by waging war on his own people,\" said McCain, who also expressed concern that the situation could provide an opening for Islamic extremists to gain a foothold in Libya.

On 9 August 2018, Gandhi was detained by immigration authorities at Bangalore Airport on his return to India. He was handed over to Chennai Police by the airport police. Gandhi was charged under Section 124 A (sedition), 153 A (1) and 153 (b) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race etc.) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) . He was produced in court the next day, where the police argued that a video of his speech uploaded by the UNHRC instigated hatred among people. Magistrate S Prakash refused to detain him and asked for him to be set free after interrogation. A few minutes after the police released him, he was again arrested, without a warrant. A video of the police kidnapping Thirumurugan Gandhi went viral on social media. Then Tamil Nadu police took him to puzhal central prison and then he was shifted to Vellore Central Prison . On 24 August 2018, Gandhi was produced in court in a sedition case filed for his criticism of corporate influence in a Facebook video. At the court, Gandhi said he had been kept in solitary confinement in the Vellore prison, prevented from meeting his family, and prevented from answering calls of nature. On 26 August, Gandhi was booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) by the Nungambakkam police.

Some variations were intentionally introduced by the Royal Mint, according to Sir John Craig in his history of it, \"to titillate the numismatists\". Sydney Mint half sovereign, 1856, depicting Queen Victoria Gold was discovered in Australia in 1851, leading to requests from colonial officials that a branch of the Royal Mint be established there. After the Sydney Mint opened in 1855, half sovereigns were struck beginning in 1855. Half sovereigns struck at Sydney from 1855 to 1866 were not of the same design as struck in London, but, as the Royal Mint feared that they would not be struck to the same standard, stated their origin at the Sydney Mint as part of the design, and were not legal tender in Britain. Dies for these issues were prepared at London. As trust grew, the Australian coins were accepted as legal tender, and, beginning in 1871, Sydney used the same shield design as did London. The Melbourne Mint opened in 1873, and struck half sovereigns the same year. The Perth Mint opened in 1899, and first struck half sovereigns in 1900. The colonial mints used dies prepared in London and transported by ship, which included mint marks on the reverse for the issues that were otherwise identical to those struck in London: S for Sydney, M for Melbourne and P for Perth.",

          "text": "The yoke generates heat whose removal is essential since the conductivity of glass goes up with increasing temperature, the glass needs to be insulating for the CRT to remain usable as a capacitor. The temperature of the glass below the yoke is thus checked during the design of a new yoke. The yoke contains the deflection and convergence coils with a ferrite core to reduce loss of magnetic force as well as the magnetized rings used to align or adjust the electron beams in color CRTs (The color purity and convergence rings, for example) and monochrome CRTs. The yoke may be connected using a connector, the order in which the deflection coils of the yoke are connected determines the orientation of the image displayed by the CRT. The deflection coils may be held in place using polyurethane glue. The deflection coils are driven by sawtooth signals that may be delivered through VGA as horizontal and vertical sync signals. A CRT needs two deflection circuits: a horizontal and a vertical circuit, which are similar except that the horizontal circuit runs at a much higher frequency (a Horizontal scan rate ) of 15–240 kHz depending on the refresh rate of the CRT and the number of horizontal lines to be drawn (the vertical resolution of the CRT). The higher frequency makes it more susceptible to interference, so an automatic frequency control (AFC) circuit may be used to lock the phase of the horizontal deflection signal to that of a sync signal, to prevent the image from becoming distorted diagonally. The vertical frequency varies according to the refresh rate of the CRT. So a CRT with a 60 Hz refresh rate has a vertical deflection circuit running at 60 Hz. The horizontal and vertical deflection signals may be generated using two circuits that work differently; the horizontal deflection signal may be generated using a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) while the vertical signal may be generated using a triggered relaxation oscillator.",

Following the ransom and the plunder of the city, Morgan returned to Port Royal, with between £70,000 and £100,000 of money and valuables; Zahedieh reports that the figures were more than the agricultural output of Jamaica, and nearly half Barbados's sugar exports. Each privateer received £120 – equivalent to five or six times the average annual earnings of a sailor of the time. Morgan received a five per cent share for his work; Modyford received a ten per cent share, which was the price of Morgan's letter of marque. As Morgan had overstepped the limits of his commission, Modyford reported back to London that he had \"reproved\" him for his actions although, Zahedieh observes, in Britain \"Morgan was widely viewed as a national hero and neither he nor Modyford were rebuked for their actions\". Lake Maracaibo and Gibraltar (1668–1669) [ edit ] Further information: Henry Morgan's raid on Lake Maracaibo Maracaibo, Cabimas, Ciudad Ojeda and Gibraltar in modern day Venezuela Morgan did not stay long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache , a small island he used as a rendezvous point. His plan was to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias , the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate , Oxford , which had been sent to Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who made it his flagship.",

Today, Singapore has four official languages, English , Malay , Mandarin , and Tamil . Malay is the ceremonial national language of the country and is the home language to 13% of the population. Although most of the younger generation of non-Malay people are non-proficient in the Malay language, Malay is used in the national anthem of Singapore and also in citations for Singapore orders and decorations and military parade drill commands. Almost all Singaporeans are bilingual since the introduction of Singapore's bilingual language education policy Singapore English , however, remains the de facto lingua franca spoken by Singaporeans today. It is the main language of instruction in all school subjects except for Mother Tongue lessons and also the common language of administration, law and business. In 2009, more than 20 languages were identified as being spoken in Singapore, reflecting a rich linguistic diversity in the city. Literature Main article: Singaporean literature Singaporean literature consists of literary works that is written in either of the 4 official languages. Although these works may be considered as literature works to their specific languages, they are also viewed as a distinct body of literature portraying various aspects of Singapore society and forms a significant part of the culture of Singapore. Singaporean literature in English was first started by the Peranakan community in colonial Singapore during the 1830s. Singaporean English literature first gained notability in 1937, with a poetry known as F.M.S.R. A Poem , written by Teo Poh Leng and was followed by Wang Gungwu 's work, Pulse, in the 1950.",

          "text": "After failing to find sufficient resources to begin a study of Quapaw , Rankin began work on the Kansa language in the summer of 1973, looking for the last three speakers of the language in Shidler, Oklahoma . One of the speakers, Maude McCauley Rowe, agreed to collaborate, but refused to share stories until the winter time, in accordance with Plains Indian tradition. Instead, Rankin recorded her recitation of the Lord's Prayer . When he returned the next day, he brought with him a transcription and recited it back to her, shocking her. Believing her language to be unable to be written down and doomed to extinction, she requested a photocopy of the transcription which she then disseminated throughout the tribe. Rankin and Rowe then met for two hours every weekday afternoon to record in two-week intervals. Rankin worked alongside Rowe and the two other speakers, Ralph Pepper and Walter Kekahbah, for three years, taking meticulous notes and recording dozens of hours of speech. He also compared his own notes with those of James Owen Dorsey , an American amateur linguist and missionary who studied the language in the 1880s and 1890s. Although some of Dorsey's notes were written in Latin to avoid contemporary anti-obscenity laws , Rankin could read Latin. While comparing Dorsey's notes to Rowe's interpretations, he once accidentally recited a bawdy story to Rowe after failing to adequately prepare his notes that morning. He later recounted: She kind of went, \"Pff, pff, pff,\" you know, through her lips, and then she just burst out laughing, laughing as hard as she could. I couldn't figure out what the deal was, and then I looked to see the translation and I saw the Latin – and I can read Latin – and it was, uh, shall we say, very questionable language, really ripe.",

          "text": "Unlike a designated hitter, a designated player can also become a temporary defensive substitute, and the player substituted by the designated player can return to their original position at a later point in the game. However, the only player that can be substituted as an offensive replacement (pinch runner or pinch hitter) is the defensive player the designated player originally replaced, known as the \"flex\". At any time, the designated player can be substituted back into the lineup in the place of the flex player, but once taken out, the designated player cannot take the place of any other player in the lineup. Short fielder [ edit ] In some leagues and organizations, four outfield players are utilized by each team. The extra outfielder is sometimes called the short fielder and plays somewhere behind second base, adjusting position based on the handedness or other characteristics of the batter, while the regular center fielder plays a considerably deeper position. The short fielder used as such can take away a batting strategy in softball, which is to hit soft liners over the pitcher. However, some teams prefer to use the fourth outfielder like the others, with the center field position being shared between two players known as the left-center fielder and the right-center fielder. In this case the four outfielders are spaced equidistantly and play at roughly the same depth. Pitch [ edit ] Unlike in baseball, softball pitches are thrown in an underhand style. In softball, a pitch is the act of throwing a softball toward home plate to start a play. All pitches are thrown from below the waist in an underhand motion. The phases of throwing include the grip, stance, windup, stride, release and follow through. Pitchers throw a variety of pitches, each of which has a slightly different velocity, trajectory, movement, hand position, wrist position and/or arm angle. These variations are introduced to confuse the batter in various ways, and ultimately aid the defensive team in getting the batter or baserunners out.",

Following a defensive holding penalty on Panthers' cornerback Josh Norman on a third-and-goal, the Broncos added to their lead, with running back C. J. Anderson rushing for a 2-yard touchdown, coupled with Manning completing a pass to wide receiver Bennie Fowler for a two-point conversion with 3:13 remaining.

Game structure [ edit ] The object of the game is to score more runs (points) than the other team by batting (hitting) a ball into play and running around the bases, touching each one in succession. The ball is a sphere of light material, covered with leather or synthetic material. It is 11 to 12 inches (28–30 cm) (or, rarely, 16 in or 41 cm ) in circumference. The game is officiated by one or more neutral umpires . Players and umpires are generally free to ask for a brief stoppage at any time when the ball is not in play (called a time out), or immediately following a play once its outcome is clear. The game is played in usually seven innings . Each inning is divided into a top half , in which the away team bats and tries to score runs, while the home team occupies the field and tries to record three outs ; then a bottom half , when the teams' roles are reversed. Some leagues play with a reduced number of innings or with a time limit, rather than the traditional seven innings. Batting and pitching [ edit ] The strike zone hovers above home plate, varying in dimensions based on the batter's height. To start play, the offense sends a batter to home plate . The batting order must be fixed at the start of the game, and players may not bat out of turn. The defense's pitcher stands atop the rubber and pitches the ball towards home plate using an underhand motion. In fast pitch, the pitcher is allowed to take one step back prior to releasing the ball during the forward movement. The batter attempts to hit the pitched ball with a bat , a long, round, smooth stick made of wood , metal or composite .",

          "text": "Product modification A design change is a modification to the design of a product or system. Design changes can happen at any stage in the product development process as well as later in the product or system's lifecycle. Design changes that happen early in the design process are less expensive when compared to those that take place after it is introduced into full-scale production. The cost of the change increases with its development time. Fundamentally, design changes can be classified into pre production and post production changes. The pre-production changes can happen in the conceptual design stage, prototype stage, detailing stage, testing stage. The post -production stage changes can happen almost immediately the product is introduced into the production or much later in the product lifecycle This might be due to many reasons including response to a changing market demand, uncovering of design faults that need to be corrected, the product or system not meeting stakeholder requirements, parts becoming obsolete or no longer available from suppliers, and so forth. One of the tools to manage design changes is the House of Quality which can help to trace the impacts of a proposed change to understand who and what will be affected. One of the issues in handling design changes is that they propagate or 'ripple out' from the points of initiation. This is because, for example, a change to one part design will also require changes to others, so they can continue to fit together and work together to deliver a design's functionality. Understanding these ripple effects may determine whether to accept a change request and in coordinating the change's implementation. A range of approaches have been developed to help predict and manage design change ripple effects. Some are quite practical while others remain in the research domain.

          "text": "This can promote a culture of \"card collecting\", where the perceived value is in the certification rather than the competence nominally associated with the card. Words like Advanced and Master , used in the context of recreational certification, such as advanced open water diver, peak performance buoyancy, master scuba diver, or master scuba diving instructor are used to market further courses where performance- or evidence-based reasons for the description are dubious or lacking, and the minimum competence level required for the related certification is quite ordinary in comparison with predecessor courses. Divers can move rapidly through the system, including to instructor level, without much breadth or depth of real-world diving experience. Talking about one's own mistakes, especially as an instructor, is not something actively promoted within most agencies, as it is perceived to expose instructors to possible litigation. The mantra of \"dive within your limits and training\", if followed, limits the divers' experience to environments where most things are controlled, and can leave them unprepared for when things do not go to plan. Other organisations encourage gradual and careful development of experience in small steps. Followed strictly, diving within ones training is extremely limiting, and it is not explained exactly what ones limits are, and they are not necessarily restricted to conditions identical to those in which training was done. Recreational diver training and certification organisations tend to avoid admitting that it may be necessary or desirable to gradually dive beyond one's current limits to develop experience, for fear that this could expose them to litigation, but divers who explore beyond the limits of their current experience, cautiously and intelligently, are the people who break new ground which those same organisations later exploit for profit. Experience and expertise come from pushing boundaries, making mistakes, failing safely, and learning from them. Failures to lead by example. Cases where high profile members and officials of organisations have very visibly grossly violated the rules of their own organisations.",

          "text": "In the case of internet governance the major private actors in this area seek to have little or no engagement with governments. Governments all have product standard-setting regulatory institutions. Multistakeholderism presents an opportunity to have an alternative arrangement that shifts the process of formulating and monitoring standards to a multistakeholder body and shifts the standards from obligatory to voluntary. Examples of this use of multistakeholder groups by governments include opting to follow the advice of expert-based multistakeholder groups rather than establish separate expert government-based organizations, welcoming efforts to have multistakeholder standards set by TNCs and civil society to avoid conflicts with home-country TNCs and other businesses (e.g. Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh ) and supporting voluntary private standard setting for un- and under-governed spaces (e.g. oceans). Many of these cases represent an indirect privatization of public services and goods. Other governments or parts of government actively participate in project-based public-private partnerships. In PPP, governments agree to grant dejura or de facto governance over a natural resource (i.e. access public water) or the area around an infrastructure project to a given multistakeholder group. The degree of control explicitly or implicitly transferred to the PPP and the extent that the initial expectations for operations and prices are not met has become a contentious governance issue. Academy and professional associations [ edit ] While over 250 academics assisted the WEF in developing their Global Redesign Initiative, most members of the academic community and most professional associations are not involved with multistakeholder groups. Those academics that are involved in multistakeholder groups tend to participate in policy making multistakeholder groups or the development of international product and process standard setting. Some university-based experts join business-oriented multistakeholder bodies in a similar manner to joining the corporate boards of individual firms.",

In addition, practice of hybrid religions is also common such as the incorporation of Taoism and Hindu traditions into Buddhism and vice versa. 2022 Research in 2022 suggested that the percentage of Buddhists, Hindus and Christians was going down, while the percentage of Singaporeans following Islam or ‘no religion’ was going up.

          "text": "Baseball player Janice Winifred O'Hara [״Jenny״] (November 30, 1918 – March 7, 2001) was a pitcher and utility who played from 1943 through 1949 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Listed at 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m), 122 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Janice O'Hara was one of the sixty original players to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for its inaugural season. A valuable and versatile player, she had an array of pitches that kept the hitters guessing, and also played several positions competently during her seven years in the league. Born in Beardstown, Illinois , O'Hara started playing organized softball in Springfield in her teen years, until AAGPBL scout Eddie Stumpf interviewed her and sent her to the final tryout at Wrigley Field in Chicago . In the process, she signed a contract and joined the Kenosha Comets , playing for them her entire career in the league. Comets manager Josh Billings used O'Hara at first base and she hit a respectable .187 average and posted career-numbers in hits (63), triples (6), runs (46) and RBI (28), helping Kenosha win the second half of the 1943 season. The team faced first-half winner Racine Belles in the best-of-five series and was shut out in three games. By 1944, new manager Marty McManus turned O'Hara into a utility player. She collected a personal-high 37 stolen bases and belted the only home run of her career in that season. After that, she mostly played at first base and in the outfield , but also filled in at second base and third base through the 1946 season.",

The team was briefly suspended for fielding Walsh, who the FA claimed was an unregistered player, before the matter was resolved; the FA admitted they \"might have\" lost the registration documents. The team's quarter-final against Arsenal, which City lost, had been postponed due to the investigation. A crucial part of his City plans since the start, Cushing started building the team around Walsh and made her one of its vice-captains . 2016 [ edit ] Walsh was injured again at the start of the 2016 league campaign but worked her way back onto the squad and, in September, was described as their \" unsung hero \" by 90min . Having gone undefeated, City won the league in September with a game to spare, Walsh described by Women's Soccer United as \"unassuming\" and \"pivotal\" in their success. In October, they won the 2016 League Cup for the domestic double . Walsh was named player of the match in City's first-ever Champions League match, a 2–0 victory against Zvezda Perm ; a month later, on 9 November 2016, she scored her first goal for City, a long-range strike from outside the area, in a 1–0 victory against Brøndby IF in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie . Cushing hailed her as \"up there with the best, if not the best, players in the league\" and, two days later, she extended her contract through 2020. For the 2015 and 2016 season, Walsh was nominated for the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Women's Young Player of the Year award; she would see further nominations for this award every year up to and including the 2018–19 season.",

This resulted in an arc-shaped track being recorded across the width of the tape. Arcuate scanning resulted in a head-to-tape speed of about 2,500 in/s (63,500 mm/s), but problems with timebase stability of the reproduced video signal from the tape led Ampex to abandon arcuate scanning in favor of the more reliable transverse scanning system. Ampex continued through the mid-1950s with the Mark II and Mark III prototype recorders. The Mark II was the first to use FM modulation to record the incoming video signal to the tape as an FM carrier modulated to the video input, resulting in a drastic improvement in video playback quality compared to the Mark I, which used AM modulation and resulted in quite poor & noisy video reproduction upon playback. The Mark IV was the machine first publicly demonstrated at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (now the NAB ) convention (the NAB Show ) in Chicago on April 14, 1956. After William Lodge of CBS finished his speech, the Mark IV replayed his image and words almost immediately, causing \"pandemonium\" among the astonished attendees. The earlier Mark III was given some cosmetic improvements, and was also demonstrated at Ampex headquarters in Redwood City the same day. Both demonstrations were a success, and Ampex took $2 million in orders for the machine in four days. The VR 1000-B model (1961) The quadruplex system Ampex later released the first models of quad VTR based on the Mark IV which were also prototypes, the VRX-1000, of which 16 were made.",

Operation of VR-1000-era machines required the skills of a highly trained video engineer . When a tape was changed, the operator spent as much as half-an-hour, \"lining-up\" the VTR—that is, carrying out specialized technical adjustments to calibrate the machine to the tape before it was ready for playback. From VR-1200/2000 onward, improvements in head manufacturing/refurbishing tolerances, timebase correction, and greater thermal stability of solid-state electronics made tape changes possible in under a minute and needed servo calibrations only once per shift. From AVR-1 onward, servos were self-calibrating and tape changes were as fast as the operator could articulate threading. The few quadruplex VTRs which remain in service are used for the transfer and/or restoration of archival 2-inch quad videotape material to newer data storage formats, although mainstream TV serials from the 1950s to late 1960s have mostly already been remastered onto more modern media some years ago, even digitized within the last decade.

          "text": "First practical, commercially successful analog recording video tape Ampex VR-2000 2-inch quadruplex videotape (also called 2\" quad video tape or quadraplex ) was the first practical and commercially successful analog recording video tape format. The format uses 2-inch-wide (51 mm) magnetic tape and was developed and released for the broadcast television industry in 1956 by Ampex , an American company based in Redwood City, California . The first videotape recorder using this format was built the same year. This format revolutionized broadcast television operations and television production , since the only recording medium available to the TV industry until then was motion picture film . Since most United States network broadcast delays by the television networks at the time used kinescope film that took time to develop, the networks wanted a more practical, cost-effective, and quicker way to time-shift television programming for later airing in Western time zones than the expensive and time-consuming processing and editing of film. Faced with these challenges, broadcasters sought to adapt magnetic tape recording technology (already used for audio recording) for use with television as well. By 1954 the television industry in the US was consuming more film stock than all Hollywood studios combined. The term \"quadruplex\" refers to the use of four magnetic record/play heads mounted on a headwheel spinning transversely (width-wise) across the tape at a rate of 14,386 RPM (for 960 recorded stripes per second) for NTSC 525 lines/30fps -standard quad decks and at 15,000 RPM (for 1,000 stripes per second) for those using the PAL 625 lines/25fps video standard. This method is called quadrature scanning, as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape formats.",

Yet, as regional Caudillos started to rise in power, nation-builders started to view themselves as more modern than their former European colonizers. Leaders began to shift away from aristocracy toward republicanism and democracy, which allowed all citizens, not just the Creole elites, to have a voice in politics. This shift helped unify many of the Latin American nations as all people, even illiterate people, would gather in their communities to talk about political ideals and how they should be used in their nation. Great Britain and the United States exercised significant influence in the post-independence era, resulting in a form of neo-colonialism , where political sovereignty remained in place, but foreign powers exercised considerable power in the economic sphere. Newly independent nations faced domestic and interstate conflicts, struggling with economic instability and social inequality. The 20th century brought U.S. intervention and the Cold War 's impact on the region, with revolutions in countries like Cuba influencing Latin American politics. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw shifts towards left-wing governments, followed by conservative resurgences, and a recent resurgence of left-wing politics in several countries. After 2000 [ edit ] UNASUR summit in the Palacio de la Moneda, Santiago de Chile In many countries in the early 2000s, left-wing political parties rose to power, known as the Pink tide .",

When the Gurak attack Lazulis, they are forced to instead help Arganan use the cannon to drive off the attack. The cannon proves insufficient, and Arganan is killed by the Outsider's power. Zael and the mercenaries aid the people while Therius holds off the attacking Gurak. Zael then heads out with Calista and the mercenaries to retrieve Zangurak's half of the Outsider. Zael defeats Jirall, and then Zangurak; during the latter battle, Lowell suffers fatal injuries. The group then find Dagran with the Outsider, claiming he used the mercenaries in his own quest for revenge against the Lazulis knights who killed his family. After absorbing the Outsider's power, Dagran is defeated; he reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet. Through Zael and Calista's efforts, humans and Gurak manage to begin coexisting, sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land. In the epilogue, Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care; Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home; the mercenaries hold a wake for Dagran; and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.

The group also meet General Asthar and his protegee Therius when Syrenne picks a fight with Therius. After Calista explains to Zael in private that hers is an arranged marriage, Lazulis is attacked by the Gurak, a race once banished from Lazulis by humans and now united under their ruler Zangurak. To avoid being killed by the ensuing cannon fire, Zael, Dagran, and Calista stow away on a Gurak ship and eventually take it over. The group are returned to Lazulis by the island's knights. On Lazulis, the mercenaries are accused of aiding the Gurak by the knight Jirall, who is trying to cover up his cowardly behavior during the attack by having anyone who witnessed it imprisoned. Dagran persuades Arganan to release them after showing him Zael's mark, which is revealed to be a mystical \"Mark of the Outsider\" given to one destined to save Lazulis. Arganan attempts to get Zael onto his side, offering him knighthood and Calista's hand in marriage. Zael swears allegiance to Arganan, who orders Zael to direct Lazulis towards the Gurak lands. During this time, Asthar accepts Zael as a new pupil and gives him a medal following a successful sparring. Shortly after this, Gurak assassins kill Asthar, who tells Zael the medal is a key before dying.",

The national party was unable to gain possession of the citadel, and Kléber, having defeated the Turks, was soon able to return to the capital. On 14 April he bombarded Bulaq, and proceeded to bombard Cairo itself, which was taken the following night. Order was soon restored, and a fine of 12 million francs was imposed upon the rioters. Murad Bey sought an interview with Kléber, and succeeded in obtaining the government of Upper Egypt from him. Murad Bey died shortly afterwards and was succeeded by Osman Bey al-Bardisi. Defeat and retreat of the French [ edit ] On 14 June, Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi , and was said to have been incited to the deed by a Janissary refugee at Jerusalem , who had brought letters to the sheikhs of Al-Azhar. Although they gave him no support, three of the sheikhs were executed by the French as accessories-before-the-fact . The assassin himself was tortured and impaled, despite the promise of a pardon if he named his associates. The command of the army then devolved on General Jacques-Francois Menou , a man who had professed Islam , and who endeavoured to conciliate the Muslim population by various measures—such as excluding all Christians (with the exception of one Frenchman) from the divan , replacing Copts who were in government service with Muslims, and subjecting French residents to taxes. Whatever popularity might have been gained by these measures was counteracted by his declaration of a French protectorate over Egypt, which was to count as a French colony.

          "text": "While recioto is typically sweet, with high levels of residual sugar , the must can be allowed to ferment completely dry . Often producers will label this wine as Amarone, but they may also choose to produce it as Valpolicella DOC wine or even an indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) table wine if they choose to use grape blends outside the DOC requirement. Some producers are experimenting with international varieties and producing dry Amarone style wines from grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon . Ripasso [ edit ] A ripasso wine from Valpolicella In the late 20th century, a new style of wine known as ripasso (meaning 'repassed') emerged. With this technique, the pomace of leftover grape skins and seeds from the fermentation of recioto and Amarone are added to the batch of Valpolicella wines for a period of extended maceration . The additional food source for the remaining fermenting yeast helps boost the alcohol level and body of the wines while also leaching additional tannins , glycerine and some phenolic compounds that contribute to a wine's complexity, flavor and color . As the production of Amarone has increased in the 21st century, so too has the prevalence of ripasso style wines appearing in the wine market, with most Amarone producers also producing a ripasso as a type of \" second wine \". An alternative method is to use partially dried grapes, instead of leftover pomace, which contain less bitter tannins and even more phenolic compounds. The first Valpolicella producer to commercially market a ripasso wine was Masi in the early 1980s. When the style first became popular in the late 20th century, it was rarely noted on the wine label. There was also debate about whether it was even permitted to be included under DOC regulations. If it was mentioned at all it was relegated to the back label wine description notes.",

Anselin referenced a range of specialist studies (anthropology, linguistics, population genetics and archaeology) presented at a triennial conference in 2005 which he stated was a continuation of the 1974 recommendations. This included a genetic study which quantified the \"key impact\" of Sub-Saharan populations and showed that the early pre-dynastic population of the Berber people of the Siwa Oasis in north-western Egypt had close demographic links with people of North-East Africa. He further described the value of other studies such as a Crubezy study which \"traced the boundaries of the ancient Khoisan settlement to Upper Egypt, where its faint traces remain identifiable and Keita’s work, as the most groundbreaking\", and that Cerny had identified close genetic and linguistic links between the peoples of Upper Egypt, North Cameroon (some of whom spoke Chadic languages) and Ethiopia (some of whom spoke Kushitic languages). E1b1b is the most common paternal haplogroup across Africa, including Egypt, with modern genetic studies rooting the origin of the E haplogroup in East Africa. Biological anthropologist S.O.Y. Keita stated that the ancient population of Egypt emerged primarily from interactions from local ancient Nilotic and Saharan populations with some groups such as the Beja in Sudan and Egypt having long assimilated peoples from local Arab pastoral groups. He also stated the presence of the E haplogroup, based on the indications from current evidence (sourced from a number of genetic studies) likely originated and experienced most genetic mutations in tropical East Africa, had widespread distribution across Africa including Egypt. Keita further stated this had implications for older conceptions of ‘race’ and African populations.",

The ancient Egyptians, like their modern descendants, were of varying complexions of color, from the light Mediterranean type (like Nefertiti), to the light brown of Middle Egypt, to the darker brown of Upper Egypt, to the darkest shade around Aswan and the First Cataract region, where even today, the population shifts to Nubian.\" [...] \"Ancient and modern Egyptian hair ranges from straight to wavy to woolly; in color, it varies from reddish brown to dark brown to black.

          "text": "Barry J. Kemp wrote in 2007 that the black/white argument, though politically understandable, is an oversimplification that hinders an appropriate evaluation of the scientific data on the ancient Egyptians since it does not take into consideration the difficulty in ascertaining complexion from skeletal remains. It also ignores the fact that Africa is inhabited by many other populations besides Bantu related (\"Negroid\") groups. He wrote that in reconstructions of life in ancient Egypt, modern Egyptians would therefore be the most logical and closest approximation to the ancient Egyptians . Kemp also wrote that \"sample populations available from northern Egypt from before the 1st Dynasty (Merimda, Maadi and Wadi Digla) turn out to be significantly different from sample populations from early Palestine and Byblos, suggesting a lack of common ancestors over a long time\" and the anthropological measurements of ancient Egyptians male limb length proportions had grouped \"them with Africans rather than with Europeans\". Barbara Mertz wrote in 2011: \"Egyptian civilization was not Mediterranean or African, Semitic or Hamitic, black or white, but all of them. It was, in short, Egyptian.\" Kathryn Bard wrote in 2014: \"Egyptians were the indigenous farmers of the lower Nile valley, neither black nor white as races are conceived of today\". David Wengrow, Michael Dee , Sarah Foster , Alice Stevenson and Christopher Bronk Ramsey wrote in 2015: \"The African origins of Egyptian civilisation lie in an important cultural horizon, the ‘ primary pastoral community ’, which emerged in both the Egyptian and Sudanese parts of the Nile Valley in the fifth millennium BC.\" Federico Puigdevall and Albert Cañagueral wrote in 2017: \"There are defenders of the theory that the pharaohs were black, and there are those who maintain they had Caucasian origins. Neither theory is provable\".",

The double-track line had two stations built on it, Tarneit and Wyndham Vale , to housing estates in those areas. The Geelong V/Line rail service was rerouted to use the line, no longer sharing tracks with Werribee line services operated by Metro Trains . Ballarat services only join the alignment at Deer Park, and Bendigo services do not use this line at all; they instead join the other part of the Regional Rail Link at Sunshine . Test trains began operating upon completion of the line in October 2014 and passenger services started on 21 June 2015. Future expansion [ edit ] In 2018 the Andrews Government announced the Western Rail Plan , which included electrification and quadruplication of the line. In 2023, it was reported that the Western Rail Plan no longer included quadruplication and there are no concrete plans to electrify the line. During the 2022 Victorian state election , the Andrews Government committed to building two new infill stations on the corridor, Tarneit West and Truganina . Site investigation works are currently underway for Tarneit West. References [ edit ] ^ \"Milestones\" . Regional Rail Link . Archived from the original on 17 June 2015 .

          "text": "SMRT was subsequently fined S$ 2.4 million (2020) ( US$ 1.74 million) and the Kawasaki C151 trains were eventually withdrawn from service in 2025. Background [ edit ] The MRT network first began operations in 1987, with the stretch between Outram Park MRT station and Clementi MRT station opening on 12 March 1988. The East–West Line (EWL) is operated by SMRT Trains . The Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 first-generation trains had been running on the EWL and the North–South Line (NSL) since the beginning of MRT operations, with an expected service life of 38 years. Past incidents on the MRT network include the Clementi rail incident on 5 August 1993, when one train became stalled at the station, leading to a collision with another train. The crash left 156 people injured. An independent inquiry panel concluded that a damaged maintenance locomotive spilled oil on the tracks the morning of the crash. On 13 April 1999, a train near Toa Payoh station on the NSL derailed due to human error of the track alignments. A power trip at Buona Vista station led to service disruptions on the EWL, NSL and the Circle Line (CCL) in April 2016. In November 2017, a software glitch in the EWL signalling system caused a collision of two trains at Joo Koon station . Another power outage on the EWL, NSL and CCL occurred in October 2020 due to a burnt power cable and a faulty circuit breaker. Incident [ edit ] At about 9 am local time on 25 September 2024, a faulty eastbound Kawasaki C151 train (T310) was pulled out of service at Clementi station . Eyewitnesses reported smoke emitting from the train as it arrived at Clementi station.",

          "text": "Under Bos the vote and seats of the PvdA nearly doubled from 15% (23 seats) in 2002 to 27% (42 seats) in 2003. This resurgence was partially credited to Bos' charisma and youthful appearance (and according to some journalists Bos' \"sexy touch\"). Balkenende's CDA however remained largest the party by a margin of two seats. The ensuing coalition formation talks between Balkenende and Bos failed after several months. The CDA went on to form a government with the conservative liberal VVD , and the progressive liberal D66 . At that time Bos was the leader of the largest opposition party. He spent considerable time reforming the PvdA's internal organisation and public image, together with the party's chairman Ruud Koole . He was criticized for his silence on important reforms and issues, and his moderacy which resulted in other parties claiming opposition leadership, among them most notably the Socialist Party . Although still enjoying large public support, criticism about his \"style over substance\" approach to politics was voiced in this period. At the December 2005 party congress, Bos announced that he aspired to become Prime Minister of the Netherlands , should the PvdA succeed in becoming the biggest party after the next parliament elections. And in the 2006 municipal elections , a few months later, the PvdA performed particularly well, becoming the largest party in local government. However, in the election campaign for the Dutch general elections of 2006 the PvdA – for the second time campaigning under his leadership – didn't manage to maintain this position as biggest party. Some considered pension reforms proposed by him to embattle the consequences of an aging population as a reason for this decline in popularity. Others emphasized a declining confidence in Bos among parts of the electorate that perceived him as \"unreliable\", as reason for this.",

Self medication with unsuitable medications Use of alcohol or recreational drugs. Inadequate rest Dehydration Time stress due to running late Overheated or chilled Poor preparation of personal equipment Poor condition of personal equipment Denial of existing medical problem Divers should not be deterred by peer pressure from declining a dive when they are ill-prepared, and they should not allow themselves to be pressured by service providers such as boat skippers and divemasters into accepting responsibility for the safety of another diver if they do not feel confident that both they and the other diver can deal adequately with any reasonably foreseeable problem that may occur during the dive. Substandard conditions of operators [ edit ] Adverse mental states [ edit ] Divers need to be aware of their surroundings as they operate in an alien environment and inattention can result in missing a critical cue which could have allowed early response to a problem. Any mental state which is likely to reduce the situational awareness of the diver will increase risk. Examples: Task fixation. Complacency. Distraction. Fatigue. Undue haste. Lack of situational awareness, inattention. Misplaced motivation. Excessive task loading. Pre-existing stress. Adverse physiological states [ edit ] Diving while in a sub-optimal physical condition reduces the reserves available for dealing with a problem. Clearly not all divers are equal in their physical strength and fitness, but people learn to compensate for personal differences, and become accustomed to dealing with situations from their ground state. Any reduction in capacity from the normal status is likely to present unfamiliar challenges in a crisis, and may precipitate an unrecoverable chain of events, as normally adequate reactions are found to be insufficient, and fail to rectify the situation as expected.",

          "text": "This computation, similar to the absolute error case, must likewise be achievable in an amount of time that is polynomial in the size of the input data and the encoding size of η (which is typically O(log(1/ η )) bits). It can be demonstrated that if a value v is polynomially computable with relative error (utilizing an algorithm that we can designate as REL), then it is consequently also polynomially computable with absolute error. Proof sketch : Let ε > 0 be the target maximum absolute error that we wish to achieve. The procedure commences by invoking the REL algorithm with a chosen relative error bound of, for example, η = 1/2. This initial step aims to find a rational number approximation r 1 such that the inequality | v − r 1 | ≤ | v |/2 holds true. From this relationship, by applying the reverse triangle inequality (| v | − | r 1 | ≤ | v − r 1 |), we can deduce that | v | ≤ 2| r 1 | (this holds assuming r 1 ≠ 0; if r 1 = 0, then the relative error condition implies v must also be 0, in which case the problem of achieving any absolute error ε > 0 is trivial, as v approx = 0 works, and we are done). Given that the REL algorithm operates in polynomial time, the encoding length of the computed r 1 will necessarily be polynomial with respect to the input size. Subsequently, the REL algorithm is invoked a second time, now with a new, typically much smaller, relative error target set to η ' = ε / (2| r 1 |) (this step also assumes r 1 is non-zero, which we can ensure or handle as a special case).",

          "text": "Z-specific genes were over-expressed in males when compared to females, and a few genes had equal expression in both male and female Z chromosomes. In chickens, most of the dosage compensated genes exist on the Zp, or short, arm of the chromosome while the non-compensated genes are on the Zq, or long, arm of the chromosome. The compensated (silenced) genes on Zp resemble a region on the primitive platypus sex chromosome, suggesting an ancestor to the XX/XY system. Birds [ edit ] The sex chromosomes of birds evolved separately from those of mammals and share very little sequence homology with the XY chromosomes. As such, scientists refer to bird sex chromosomes as a ZW sex-determining system, with males possessing two Z chromosomes, and females possessing one Z chromosome and one W. Thus, dosage compensation in birds could be hypothesized to follow a pattern similar to the random X-inactivation observed in most mammals. Alternatively, birds might show decreased transcription of the two Z chromosomes present in the male heterogametic sex, similar to the system observed in the two hermaphrodite X chromosomes of C. elegans . However, bird mechanisms of dosage compensation differ significantly from these precedents. Instead, male birds appear to selectively silence only a few genes along one of their Z chromosomes, rather than randomly silencing one entire Z chromosome. This type of selective silencing has led some people to label birds as \"less effective\" at dosage compensation than mammals. However, more recent studies have shown that those genes on the Z chromosome which are not inactivated in birds may play an important role in recruiting dosage compensation machinery to the Z chromosome in ZZ organisms. In particular, one of these genes, ScII has been demonstrated to be an ortholog of xol-1, the master sex regulator gene in C. elegans.",

          "text": "The male Atlantic mudskipper will guard and take care of the eggs within the burrow. Lifecycle [ edit ] The average lifespan of an Atlantic mudskipper is approximately five years. The egg laid by the mother in the burrow will hatch into larvae that swim out of the burrow and drift for 30–50 days. As Atlantic mudskippers are territorial, juvenile mudskippers will hide in mud until they are grown enough to protect their established territory. Usage by humans [ edit ] The Atlantic mudskippers are used by humans as food, bait, ornamental fishes , and for medicine . It is important to local indigenous peoples as a food fish and can also be found in the aquarium trade. Fishing has caused population declines in parts of the species' range. Mudskippers can be used as a bio-indicator of pollution in marine ecosystems as they are sensitive to the environment and have an absorptive body. Analyses can be performed by examining various organs of the mudskipper. The digestive system, gills, and skin are common places of the Atlantic mudskipper that are contaminated by heavy metals , like copper and iron . A less invasive method of using mudskippers as a bio-indicator is to use their growth and development as a measure for potential contamination. Threats and conservation [ edit ] The conservation status of the Atlantic mudskipper is currently classified as a species of 'Least Concern.' Declines in Atlantic mudskipper populations may be a result of overfishing , unregulated pollution , and unsuitable fishing methods, for instance, electric fishing. The Atlantic mudskipper is also threatened by the increase in urban development within its habitat. Although mudskippers have been found to be able to tolerate cyanide in environments, the use of cyanide can be fatal to all life stages of the Atlantic mudskipper.",

Description [ edit ] This rockfowl measures approximately 33 to 38 centimetres (13 to 15 in) in length, with its notably long tail contributing about 14 centimetres (5.5 in). This species does not show sexual dimorphism . The adult's head is largely featherless, and the skin on the forehead and forecrown as well as the upper mandible of the beak behind the bird's nostril is a powder blue. The lower mandible and rest of the upper mandible are black. This beak is unusually large and crow-like at 30 millimetres (1.2 in) in length and is also decurved. There are some small, bristle-like feathers located on the crown that can be erected. Behind the crown, the species' bare skin on the hindcrown and nape is carmine in coloration and has a few more bristle-like feathers. The area between these patches of skin, as well as the lores, cheeks, and ear region, are featherless with black skin. Its eyes are dark brown. The grey-necked rockfowl's mantle, back, rump, and uppertail coverts are all grey. The feathers on the rump are long, dense, and silky. Additionally, the tail is grey. The rockfowl's chin, throat, sides of the neck, and upper breast are all a pale grey. This bird is buffy lemon in colour on its lower breast, belly, flanks, thighs, and undertail coverts, though the flanks can sometimes appear to be greyish. The wing is grey, though the wing's remiges are black, forming a line between the lemon underparts and grey upperparts.",

DJ Z of DJ Booth called the pairing of John Legend and Andre 3000 \"an absolute musical match\", stating that it is \"so harmonious, in fact, that it should have plenty of fans clamoring for an entire collaborative project.\" Christine Van Dusen of Paste Magazine said that the song was almost as good as \" Used to Love U \" ( Get Lifted , 2004). Claire Allfree of Metro called \"Green Light\" an \"effervescent dance-floor filler\". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote that \" Andre's near-apathetic wordplay on the former is hardly the way to fulfill the legacy of \" Bombs Over Baghdad ,\" nor is Kanye's \"kiddies\"/\"titties\" rhyming scheme on the latter going to get him into graduate school, but as guest spots on a John Legend album, they are the sonic equivalent of unclenching buttocks.\" Eric R. Danton of Sound Check welcomed the \"dazzling, ebullient wordplay\" presented by Andre 3000 on the track. Chart performance [ edit ] On September 20, 2008, almost a month after the single's release, \"Green Light\" debuted at number ninety-six on the Billboard Hot 100 . On December 6, 2008, the song peaked at number twenty-four, tying with Legend's 2005 single \" Ordinary People \" ( Get Lifted , 2004) as his highest peaking single on the chart at the time; \" All of Me \" ultimately peaked at number one in 2014.",

          "text": "Most arguments which demonstrate market efficiency assume that individuals care about only their own consumption and not others' consumption and therefore do not consider the situations that give rise to Sen's paradox. In fact, this shows a strong relationship between Sen's paradox and the well known result that markets fail to produce Pareto outcomes in the presence of externalities . Externalities arise when the choices of one party affect another. Classic examples of externalities include pollution or overfishing . Because of their nosy preferences, Alice's choice imposes a negative externality on Bob and vice versa. To prevent the paradox, Sen suggests that \"The ultimate guarantee for individual liberty may rest not on rules for social choice but on developing individual values that respect each other's personal choices.\" Doing so would amount to limiting certain types of nosy preferences, or alternatively restricting the application of the Pareto principle only to those situations where individuals fail to have nosy preferences. Note that if we consider the case of cardinal preferences—for instance, if Alice and Bob both had to state, within certain bounds, how much happiness they would get for each color of each house separately, and the situation which produced the most happiness were chosen—a minimally-liberal solution does not require that they have no nosiness at all, but just that the sum of all \"nosy\" preferences about one house's color are below some threshold, while the \"non-nosy\" preferences are all above that threshold. Since there are generally some questions for which this will be true—Sen's classic example is an individual's choice of whether to sleep on their back or their side—the goal of combining minimal liberalism with Pareto efficiency, while impossible to guarantee in all theoretical cases, may not in practice be impossible to obtain. Pareto [ edit ] Alternatively, one could remain committed to the universality of the rules for social choice and to individual rights and instead reject the universal application of the Pareto principle.",

Larissa Nordholt argued that Diop's chapter was politically motivated, having been published only due to being in line with UNESCO's political imperatives, despite clashing with accepted historical methods and standards of academic rigor . Peter Shinnie reviewing the GHA volume, wrote that \"It seems that UNESCO and [the editor] Mokhtar were embarrassed by the unscholarly and preposterous nature of Diop's views but were unable to reject his contribution\". However, Bethwell Allan Ogot , a Kenyan historian and editor of UNESCO General History of Africa Volume 5, stated that “Cheikh Anta Diop wrested Egyptian civilization from the Egyptologists and restored it to the mainstream of African history”. Stephen Quirke argued that the UNESCO-sponsored conference on the General History of Africa in 1974 \"did not change the Eurocentric climate of research\" and of the need to incorporate both African-centred studies and White European, academic perspectives. He later outlined that \"research conferences and publications on the history and language of Kemet [Egypt] remain dominated, beyond 90%, by those brought up and trained in European, not African societies and languages (which include Arabic)\". 2025 UNESCO multidisciplinary review 2010 Scientific Committee Meeting for the General History of Africa In 2025, members of the UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of New Volumes IX, X and IX of General History of Africa reviewed the 1974 Symposium with the availability of new sources of data.

For his degree, Franco prepared his departmental honors thesis as a novel under the supervision of Mona Simpson . Franco was selected as the commencement speaker at UCLA, and was to speak at the ceremony on June 12, 2009. Several months before commencement, an editorial in the student newspaper questioned his \"caliber\" and a student created a Facebook page protesting the choice. On June 3, Franco withdrew, citing a date conflict with location pre-production on a film. On January 26, 2011, Franco and the Harvard Lampoon released a satirical video on prominent comedy website Funny or Die mocking his last-minute cancellation. Franco moved to New York to simultaneously attend graduate school at Columbia University School of the Arts for writing, New York University 's Tisch School of the Arts for filmmaking, and Brooklyn College for fiction writing, while also attending the low-residency MFA Program for Writers at North Carolina 's Warren Wilson College for poetry. He received his M.F.A. from Columbia in 2010. As of 2010, Franco was studying in the Ph.D. program in English at Yale University . He has also attended the Rhode Island School of Design . In an interview with Showbiz411 , on September 23, 2010, Franco made the erroneous public announcement that he received a \"D\" grade in \"Acting\" class at the NYU Graduate Film School. He had, in fact, received that grade in a \"Directing the Actor\" class. Franco's professor, José Angel Santana, alleged that Franco did not earn his grades while attending that school and stated that Franco only received high marks and a degree because of his celebrity status as an actor. Franco made unfavorable comments about Santana's teaching.",

          "text": "None of the men responsible for the riot was charged or brought to trial. Two months later, a Congressional investigation re-examined the case but failed to identify the first shooter in the courthouse. The only person convicted of actions related to the riot was an Alabama KKK man charged with raping a black woman. Effects [ edit ] The Meridian riot highlighted the fact that blacks in the South were poorly armed, economically dependent on whites for jobs, and new to freedom; they had difficulty resisting violent attacks without federal help. By the mid-1870s, as war memories faded, Northern whites became tired of supporting the expensive programs to try to suppress the violence in the South and more inclined to let the states handle their own problems. Most Northerners viewed slavery as a moral wrong but did not necessarily believe in racial equality. They were discouraged by the continuing insurgency in much of the South. Whites resorted to force to suppress the opposition. With waning federal help, blacks had difficulty resisting white violence. The riot marked the decline of Republican power and the waning of Reconstruction in this part of Mississippi. By 1875 in Mississippi, paramilitary insurgent groups, such as the Red Shirts and rifle leagues, described as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\" had arisen in the Klan's place. They worked openly to intimidate Republican voters, especially freedmen, and run officials out of office. The insurgents suppressed voting to achieve Democratic landslide victories in the 1875 state elections. By the late 1870s, the Democrats had completed their takeover in Mississippi and other former Confederate states. With control reestablished at the state government level, conservative Democrats passed electoral laws and constitutional amendments to restrict voting by freedmen and poor whites, resulting in their disfranchisement for decades. Mississippi was the first to pass such an amendment in 1890.",

Production on the sixteenth season was later cut short as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , finishing only twenty-one of the twenty-five episodes ordered; at the time it was unknown whether or not the four additional episodes would be produced as part of the seventeenth season. In September 2020, Variety reported that the season would begin filming later that month. Pompeo announced that filming had begun on September 8. An ABC insider later revealed that the network was looking to produce a season of sixteen episodes, down from the twenty-four to twenty-five episodes per season that had been produced since the eighth season , but that the number could change since conditions were uncertain due to COVID. One additional episode was ordered, bringing the total episode count of the season up to seventeen. The lower episode count caused the season to tie with the fourth for the second-lowest number of episodes, only having more than the first . To limit the spread of COVID-19, cast and crew members only worked ten-hour days compared to the usual twelve hours. The number of people in each scene also had to be reduced to allow for social distancing . Vernoff said that face masks were worn by all cast and crew members while not filming, including between takes and during rehearsals, and that speaking was not allowed in the hair and makeup trailer. Cast members carried their own makeup bags to do last-minute touch-ups, and different camera lenses were used to make people standing far apart appear closer together. In addition, the cast and crew members received testing for the virus three times a week. In March 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported that another spin-off series was in the works following an interview with ABC Entertainment President Craig Erwich.",

          "text": "Throughout the day, security forces and separatists clashed in Buea, Bamenda and other cities. By October, the conflict had spread to most of Southern Cameroons. The ADF alone had clashed with the army 83 times, separatist militias were now active in 12 divisions, and attacks were now more lethal. According to an International Crisis Group analyst, by October the war had reached a stalemate, with the army being unable to defeat the separatists, while the separatists were not militarily strong enough to expel the army. Others described the separatists as severely outgunned and on the verge of defeat, mostly due to their lack of access to proper weapons. On 7 October, the day of the Cameroonian presidential election , there were clashes all over Southern Cameroons with both sides blaming the other; the Cameroonian government claimed that separatists moved to prevent what they considered a foreign election to take place in the Anglophone regions, while the separatists blamed the government for instigating the violence. This resulted in a very low turnout, as \"more than 90 percent of residents\" fled violence in some localities; and in many cases no officials showed up to man the polling stations. In Bamenda, at least 20 separatist fighters moved around openly to prevent people from voting. Two separatists were killed by government troops while attacking a polling station. Following the election, two people from Kumba were murdered for having voted. On 17 October, SDF President John Fru Ndi 's house in Bamenda was set on fire by armed men. On 23 October, the Cameroonian Army launched simultaneous attacks on seven or more separatist camps in the Northwest Region, initiating battles that continued for more than 24 hours. At least 30 separatists were killed, as well as an unknown number of Cameroonian soldiers.",

          "text": "Sound [ edit ] As was the common practice for Italian films at the time, shooting was done without sound; dialogue was added later along with music and sound effects. As a consequence, cast members generally spoke in their native language during filming: Quinn and Basehart in English, Masina and the others in Italian. Liliana Betti , Fellini's long-time assistant, has described the director's typical procedure regarding dialogue during filming, a technique he called the \"number system\" or \"numerological diction\": \"Instead of lines, the actor has to count off numbers in their normal order. For instance, a line of fifteen words equals an enumeration of up to thirty. The actor merely counts till thirty: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. etc.\" Biographer John Baxter has commented on the usefulness of such a system: \"It helps pinpoint an instant in the speech where he [Fellini] wants a different reaction. 'Go back to 27,' he'll tell an actor, 'but this time, smile.'\" Since he didn't need to worry about noise while shooting a scene, Fellini kept up a running commentary during filming, a practice that scandalized more traditional filmmakers, like Elia Kazan : \"He talked through each take, in fact yelled at the actors. 'No, there, stop, turn, look at her, look at her. See how sad she is, see her tears? Oh, the poor wretch! You want to comfort her? Don't turn away; go to her. Ah, she doesn't want you, does she? What? Go to her anyway!' ... That's how he's able ... to use performers from many countries. He does part of the acting for the actors.\" Since Quinn and Basehart did not speak Italian, both were dubbed in the original release.",

          "text": "Due to Singapore's diverse ethnic makeup, the Singapore Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnicity, race, religion, denomination, descent, and place of birth. The state thus promotes the cultural diversity of multiculturalism and multiracialism, instead of a single cultural assimilation. About 70% of Singaporeans also identify with other ethnic cultures in Singapore, notably the Chinese, Malay and Indian cultures. Major festivals including Chinese New Year , Hari Raya Puasa , Deepavali , Vesak Day , Christmas , Good Friday , Easter , and New Year's Day which are celebrated by the different major racial and religious groups are designated as public holidays. Former Prime Ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have stated that Singapore does not fit the traditional description of a nation, calling it a society-in-transition, pointing out the fact that Singaporeans do not all speak the same language, share the same religion, nor have the same customs. Each Singaporean's behaviours and attitudes are influenced by, among other things, his or her home language and his religion. Singaporeans who speak English as their native language tend to lean toward Western culture and Christian culture , while those who speak Chinese as their native language tend to lean toward Chinese culture and Confucianism . Malay-speaking Singaporeans tend to lean toward Malay culture , which itself is closely linked to Islamic culture . Cuisine Further information: Singaporean cuisine Hainanese chicken rice Singaporean cuisine has been largely influenced by different cultures because of its position as an international shipping port since its founding as a British port in 1819. The main influences on Singaporean cuisine came from Chinese, Malay and Indian cuisines, similar to the ethnic makeup of Singaporeans. It is believed that certain dishes that are part of Singaporean cuisine today predates the arrival of Raffles in 1819, some of these dishes include laksa , biryani and betel quid .",

Despite the African Union deciding to disregard an International Criminal Court warrant for Gaddafi's arrest, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement on 6 July saying Botswana supports the warrant and intends to enforce it. Botswana recognized NTC on 11 August. Burkina Faso – On 24 August, the government announced that it recognised the National Transitional Council but was prepared to offer Gaddafi asylum if he requested it, even though Burkina Faso is a member of the International Criminal Court , which has issued a warrant for Gaddafi's arrest. Cape Verde – The government recognised the National Transitional Council as \"the legitimate interlocutor\" of Libya on 26 June and reiterated its recognition on 26 August, calling for a peaceful democratic transition and respect for Libya's territorial integrity. Chad – President Idriss Déby Itno said he was \"100 percent sure\" that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb looted Libyan military arsenals and stole surface-to-air missiles , saying, \"The Islamists of al Qaeda took advantage of the pillaging of arsenals in the rebel zone to acquire arms, including surface-to-air missiles, which were then smuggled into their sanctuaries in Tenere.\" Déby also said al Qaeda was actively fighting against Gaddafi in the rebellion, saying \"There is a partial truth in what [Gaddafi] says.

Manuel Buendía Tellezgirón (24 May 1926 – 30 May 1984) was a Mexican journalist and political columnist who last worked for the daily Excélsior , one of the most-read newspapers in Mexico City . His direct reporting style in his column Red Privada (\"Private Network\"), which publicly exposed government and law enforcement corruption, organized crime, and drug trafficking, was distributed and read in over 200 newspapers across Mexico. Born in the state of Michoacán , Buendía first wrote for La Nación , the official magazine of the National Action Party (PAN). After losing interest in the party, he left to work for La Prensa and became the editor-in-chief in 1960. He left the newspaper in 1963 and worked for several different media outlets in Mexico throughout the 1970s and '80s, including the Mexico City-based newspapers El Universal and Excélsior . Buendía was recognized largely for his investigative reporting, and particularly for his coverage of the CIA 's covert operations in Mexico, the rise of ultra-rightwing groups, fraudulent businessmen, corruption in Mexico's state-owned petroleum company Pemex , and the role of organized crime in Mexico's political system. He was also famous for breaking news on controversial political subjects thanks to his access to top Mexican officials. His investigative reporting, however, angered many and made him a frequent target of death threats, which he took very seriously. On the afternoon of 30 May 1984, Buendía left his office in Mexico City and was walking to his car when a man shot him from behind several times, killing him on the scene. For over five years, the murder case remained unsolved and with several irregularities, including the loss of evidence.",

It was established in 1709 by Mirwais Hotak , who led a successful rebellion against the declining Persian Safavid empire in the region of Loy Kandahar (\"Greater Kandahar\") in what is now southern Afghanistan. In 1715, Mirwais died of natural causes and his brother Abdul Aziz succeeded him. He did not reign long as he was killed by his nephew Mahmud , who overthrew the Safavid Shah and established his own rule over Iran. Mahmud in turn was succeeded by his cousin Ashraf following a palace coup in 1725. Ashraf also did not retain his throne for long, as the Iranian conqueror Nader-Qoli Beg (later Shah ), under the resurgent Safavid banner, defeated him at the Battle of Damghan in 1729. Ashraf Hotak was banished to what is now southern Afghanistan, limiting Hotak rule to just a small corner of their once large empire. Hotak rule came to an end in 1738, when Nader Shah defeated Ashraf's successor Hussain Hotak after the lengthy siege of Kandahar . Subsequently, Nader Shah began re-establishing Iranian suzerainty over regions lost to Iran's archrivals, the Ottoman and Russian Empires , decades earlier.",

The result was a complete defeat for his army, after which he declined to leave his tent; he was captured after a brave resistance and taken to Cairo, where he died seven days later. After Ali Bey's death, Egypt became once more a dependency of the Porte, governed by Abu-'l-Dhahab as Sheikh al-Balad with the title pasha . He shortly afterwards received permission from the Porte to invade Syria, with the view of punishing Ali Bey's supporter Daher al-Umar, and left Ismail Bey and Ibrahim Bey as his deputies in Cairo—who, by deserting Ali at the Battle of Salihiyya, had brought about his downfall. After taking multiple cities in Palestine, Abu-'l-Dhahab died, the cause being unknown; Murad Bey , another of the deserters at Salihiyya, brought his forces back to Egypt on 26 May 1775.

In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp , but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan 's Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion. Domestic policy See also: Social policy of the Obama administration The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 , relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.

He is currently Senator of the Republic of Uruguay as a member of the Frente Amplio coalition, and was the founder of New Space party. He was the seventh of ten children, and is the son of Zelmar Michelini , a former senator who was assassinated in Buenos Aires during Operation Condor . As a result, he has been active in human rights issues, primarily those stemming from the dictatorship . In the elections of 1984, the first since the end of the military dictatorship which had ruled Uruguay from 1973 to 1984, Michelini was elected to the city council in Montevideo running for the Party for the Government of the People . Five years later, he joined the breakaway group led by Hugo Batalla , forming a new party, the New Area, supporting the presidential candidacy of Batlle for the elections of 1989, in which Michelini was elected deputy. In 1994, he disagreed with the alliance between Hugo Batalla and the Colorado Party , and in response founded the New Space party with other dissidents. The party is part of the Frente Amplio coalition, and has twice nominated Michelini for President of Uruguay. In the first election in 1994 he obtained 5.16% of total votes cast, while in 1999 he obtained 4.56% of the vote. On both occasions he was elected Senator. In 2003 he reached an agreement with the Progressive Encounter-Broad Front, called the New Majority, in which he returned to his old political party. Some sections of the New Space directed by Pablo Mieres disagreed with this decision, left the party, and founded the Independent Party . The Frente Amplio won the election in 2004, and as part of the coalition Michelini won a seat in the Senate .",

Aided by the political climate of the postwar period, the party experienced its peak in the 1950s: It was represented by the biggest parliamentary delegation in the Federal Council , and from 1954 to 1958 the party occupied three out of seven seats in the cabinet. Nonetheless, the party had to relinquish the third seat in favor of the ' magic formula ', which was introduced to the cabinet in 1959. In 1957 it changed its name to the Conservative-Christian-Social People's Party ( German : Konservativ-Christlichsoziale Volkspartei ) and to its current name in 1970. In the ensuing decades, the Catholic voter base dissolved somewhat. The reduction of the voter base, in addition to less cohesion among politicians in the party, led to six successive losses in federal elections after 1980. The party lost its support over a number of years. Beginning in the 1990s, conservative voters from former strongholds of the CVP switched to vote for the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party . From the 1995 election to the 2019 election , the CVP's vote share decreased from 16.8% to 11.4%. After the 2003 election , Ruth Metzler of the CVP, was replaced by Christoph Blocher of the Swiss People's Party on the Federal Council , leaving the CVP with only one seat in the country's executive. CVP President Gerhard Pfister and BDP President Martin Landolt , the leader of the Conservative Democratic Party, had ongoing discussions about a merger throughout 2020. In 2020, Pfister announced that the national CVP would undergo a change in branding with a new name and logo as part of a merger with the BDP.",

Although the Ndumo communities legally contested their right to the land, with a land claim settled in their favour in 2000, they were denied the right to resettle the land, instead given financial restitution and (in theory) a say in management. One resident recalls their period of residence as follows: There we were rich; we ate sweet potatoes, bananas, madumbe [root vegetable], cassava and pumpkins. We drank from the Usuthu River. Today that river is reserved for the hippos and crocodiles while our children die from drought. The wild fruits are left to fatten the monkeys, and the rhinos graze on the graves of our ancestors. The unresolved dispute over control of this land (there are allegations of another, so far undiscovered alternative agreement) and ongoing issues with Community Based Natural Resource Management as a conservation model in the province (Meer 2010), along with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of development, has resulted in the anomalous situation that the eastern part of this declared provincial game reserve has been illegally fished, grazed and farmed since 2010. This is despite its status as a Ramsar wetland of international importance, declared in 1997. Farmland is replacing the indigenous vegetation and wildlife, formerly important hippopotamus habitat and winter grazing grounds, and crocodiles no longer nest along the river which was their historical nesting area in the reserve (Carnie, 2021).

Louisa's father supported American independence , and the Johnsons left England in 1778 in response to the American Revolutionary War . They moved to Nantes , France, where they lived for the next five years. While in France, Louisa attended a Catholic boarding school . She performed well in school, becoming proficient in music and literature, and she learned to speak French fluently. She also practiced Catholicism. Such was her immersion in French that she was later forced to relearn English. She was also versed in Greek and Latin. The Johnsons lived in luxury, even when they did not have the financial means to do so. Their home in France was a mansion that came to be known as \"The Temple of Taste\". The Johnsons returned to England and settled in Tower Hill , while Louisa was placed in a London boarding school. She was teased for her French mannerisms, and the Catholicism that she had learned in France caused conflict with her Anglican religious education in England. Her self-esteem suffered, and she kept a distance from her peers. She was sent to be educated by John Hewlett , an Anglican minister and a family friend of the Johnsons. Hewlett became a strong influence on her upbringing, encouraging her intellectualism. The Johnsons suffered financially in 1788, and she was pulled out of school to be educated by a governess . Marriage (1790–1797) [ edit ] Portrait by Edward Savage , 1794 Johnson's father was appointed the American consul to Great Britain in 1790, and she often assisted in entertaining prominent guests. Among these guests, the Johnson daughters looked for potential suitors, as they were pressured to marry a prominent young man. John Quincy Adams became one such guest in 1795 in his capacity as an American diplomat.",

          "text": "Later life [ edit ] A group of Victoria Cross recipients gathered to march in the 1938 Sydney Anzac Day march. Statton is in the centre, fifth from right. Following his discharge, Statton settled in Fitzgerald, Tasmania, where he gained employment in the timber industry. True to her word that she would leave him if he went off to war, Statton's wife divorced him on 1 October 1920. Five years later, on 21 December 1925, he married Eliza Grace Hudson (née Parker) at the Registrar General's Office, Hobart. In 1934, severe bushfires broke out in the Derwent Valley, and Statton took a prominent role in rescue work aiding families isolated by the fire. During the Second World War , Statton enlisted for service with the Volunteer Defence Corps of the Australian Military Forces. Commissioned as a lieutenant on 18 June 1942, he served throughout the war with the 5th Battalion, Volunteer Defence Corps, until his discharge on 9 January 1946. Statton's wife died in 1945, and on 16 December 1947, he married Monica Enid Effie Kingston; the pair later had a son. The couple lived at Ouse , where Statton worked as a commercial agent and was a member of the local council. In 1956, Statton joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London's Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the award. At the Repatriation General Hospital, Hobart , on 5 December 1959, Statton died of stomach cancer . Accorded a full military funeral, Statton was cremated and his ashes interred at the Cornelian Bay Cemetery . His Victoria Cross is currently on display at the Australian War Memorial .

          "text": "If a pattern can be identified this may inform procedures and legislation to reduce the risk of the same pattern of accident recurring in the future. An investigation may identify shortcomings in training or procedures, or problems with equipment. Fatalities are often investigated as potential crimes until the cause of death has been identified. Insurance claims may rely on information from an investigation to establish whether the accident is covered by a policy. Occupational health and safety inspectors may investigate an occupational diving incident to identify whether regulations have been violated. Civil litigation for claimed damages can be more equitably decided when the circumstances leading to the injury have been identified. The ability to provide documentary evidence showing that correct procedure was followed can simplify the investigation and may lead to more accurate and reliable findings. Equipment, procedures, organization, environment, individual factors and interactions between them are the sources of contributing and compounding events and conditions. Analysis of near accidents can be of great value to identify sources of error and allow planning to reduce or eliminate contributing and compounding conditions. A safety study estimated about a million shortcuts taken per fatal accident. Accident investigations typically focus on the end event, and attempt to erect barriers to similar accidents, such as personal protection equipment, backup equipment or alarm systems. These are intended to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents, and are often effective in this limited goal. Accidents continue to occur because the majority of the contributing and compounding factors are not addressed. Human behavior and the systems in which people work are too complex to analyse all possible interactions. A more effective route to accident prevention is to reduce or mitigate the occurrence of human error by focusing on the contributing and compounding human factors that create an environment in which accidents are likely to occur. The quality of diving accident investigation in the US is very variable between states.",

Its vision is \"An ASEAN region whose biological is conserved, sustainably managed and used, and equitably shared for the well-being of its peoples.\" The ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) in the Philippines serves as the secretariat of the ASEAN Heritage Parks Programme. The ASEAN Heritage Parks were established as the ASEAN national heritage parks, nature parks and wild life sanctuary on 29 November 1984 when only 6 countries: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand were member countries. They became known by the present name on 18 December 2003 after Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam joined the organisation between 1995 and 1999. Through declarations, ASEAN member countries agreed that, \"common cooperation is necessary to conserve and manage the parks for the development and implementation of regional conservation as well as regional mechanisms complementary to national efforts to implement conservation measures. Fifty ASEAN Heritage Parks have been designated as of 2019. Nine sites are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Kinabalu National Park of Malaysia; Gunung Mulu National Park of Malaysia; Lorentz National Park of Indonesia; Kerinci Seblat National Park and Gunung Leuser National Park as 2 of 3 national parks that form Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra of Indonesia; Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park of the Philippines; Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary of the Philippines; Khao Yai National Park and Kaeng Krachan National Park of Thailand.

          "text": "The disruption caused significant increases in travel times, with The Straits Times reporting that a typical journey from Jurong East to Redhill took approximately 90 minutes instead of the usual 21 minutes. Queues at bus stops serving the affected stations were as long as 100 metres (330 ft). Many commuters were also confused with the transport arrangements, such as the location of free bridging bus stops for closed stations. Some voiced their frustration regarding the disruption and its spillover effects, including the longer travel time and the long walking distance between Jurong East station and its free bridging bus stop. It is estimated that the disruption affected more than 2.1 million commuters as of 30 September, with 358,000 passengers on the first day, 516,000 passengers on the second day, and 500,000 passengers on the third day of the disruption. According to minister Chee, commuters travelling between Boon Lay and Queenstown were not charged, with bridging and regular bus services provided for free. The incident occurred during the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). In response to the disruption, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced that students taking the PSLE on 26 September were granted the full allocated time to sit their paper as long as they turned up before the end of the exam. Free taxi services were offered to ferry students to their examination venues from affected stations, though according to The Straits Times , the taxis were not used by the students. According to MOE, five students were late for their papers on 26 September due to the disruption. One student took the examination in another examination centre, and all of them were given the full duration of the paper. Additionally, according to the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB), no candidates were affected by the disruption for the Mathematics exam on 27 September. On 30 September, the SEAB reported that seven students were late for their papers on that day.",

All of the equipment aforementioned needed replacement, with the point machines requiring realignment and careful recalibration. Emergency repair works began the same day, with over 300 engineers involved in rectification and replacement works. Investigations were currently ongoing. Free regular bus services were offered between Queenstown and Boon Lay stations, while bridging buses started running between Buona Vista and Jurong East in 9:58 am by SMRT Buses , SBS Transit , Tower Transit and Go-Ahead Singapore . Police officers, LTA ground staff, and personnel from the bridging bus operators were deployed to manage the crowds at the affected stations. Shuttle train services between Queenstown and Buona Vista stations, as well as between Jurong East and Boon Lay stations, were activated at 3:56 pm and later 4:11 pm, respectively. By 26 September, the shuttle train services were running at 10-minute intervals. While the authorities initially hoped to restore partial services between Jurong East and Buona Vista by 27 September, this was ruled out in favour of minimising delays in restoring full services with the new deadline set for 30 September. Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat issued an apology for the disruptions in a Facebook post. Before moving the train back to Ulu Pandan Depot , the engineers attached a temporary axle box to the train and used a hydraulic system to move the wheel back on the rail. The power cables and two of the three point machines were replaced on 27 September, with repairs on the third rail expected to be completed on the same day. During maintenance, the engineers had to use mechanical jigs instead of rail vehicles due to the broken rails. The next day, SMRT and LTA reported that their engineers made \"significant progress\" with the maintenance as well as completion of heavy rail delivery work.",

Regulatory and parliamentary response [ edit ] The LTA and representatives from public bus operators met on 2 October 2024 to discuss their management of the bridging bus services during the disruption to examine improvements needed for such incident management plans. In 2025, CNA reported that SMRT's recovery efforts incurred costs exceeding S$ 10 million ( US$ 7.46 million). On 1 November, SMRT announced the establishment of a tripartite workgroup – comprising representatives from LTA, SMRT and the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) – that would oversee the reliability and safety of the rail network. A total of 37 Parliamentary Questions were filed towards transport minister Chee Hong Tat , with 19 questions answered on 14 October. Chee outlined the circumstances of the incident in his ministerial statement, noting that some details would only be confirmed after investigations were completed. Addressing questions on fare increases, he explained that service levels and disruptions are not considered in the Public Transport Council's (PTC) fare review exercise, which is focused on financial sustainability and changes in operating costs. Reliability is managed separately through penalties and incentive schemes. Chee added that SMRT would bear all costs arising from the disruption – including free transport services, lost fare revenue, and repair works – and that affected staff would be compensated for overtime. Investigation [ edit ] The incident has been described by experts as \"rare\", with Jumadi Husani from the Dubai Road and Transport Authority 's pointing out that the axle box, bogie and train wheels should not have come off under normal circumstances, and believed it was \"mainly due to improper installation of parts after maintenance or testing activities or if defective components ... are not replaced\".",

          "text": "The saline groundwater that emerges from the gas production is injected into an empty gas field in the original rock layer at Borgsweer . The natural gas condensate that is released is transported by inland shipping to refineries in Botlek . After decades of production, the pressure in the Groningen field decreased. The Groningen Long Term Project (GLT) was started in 1997 to counteract the pressure drop. This project was completed in 2009. Compressors are installed that can bring the pressure of the field back to the desired level. The total investment amount was approximately two billion euros. During this renovation, the characteristic flare towers with pilot light disappeared at many locations. Initially, gas extraction had a strong seasonal pattern. In winter, there was a high demand for gas for heating purposes, hence more was produced. From 2015 the goal has been to achieve equal production throughout the year. This was because the pressure decreased and less could be extracted per day, but also to limit earthquakes. For this purpose, natural gas is stored in underground gas storages in the summer. There are three gas storage facilities in the Netherlands: Bergermeer gas storage , Langelo / Norg and Grijpskerk . Natural gas production in the Groningen gas field. Natural gas revenue [ edit ] A large part of the revenue from the Groningen field ends up as natural gas revenue [ nl ] with the Dutch State. Initially, about 70% of the revenues from the Groningen field went to the Dutch state. Minister of Economic Affairs Ruud Lubbers raised this to 85-95% during his term of office (1973-1977). As of January 1, 2018, this was reduced to 73%, in line with other gas fields. The reason for this was that gas extraction decreased, but the costs of the NAM for compensation and reinforcement increased.",

Blokker Holding is active in twelve countries and in 2010 all the chains combined had 2825 stores. In 2015 the company had a revenue of 2.1 billion euro, of which 98 million euros from online retail. Most store chains have both stores they own and stores that are franchised to other investors. In 2017, Intertoys was sold to private equity firm Alteri Investors for an undisclosed sum. Blokker Holding also stated that it would sell Xenos and Leen Bakker. On 22 January 2019, Blokker Holding sold Maxi Toys to Green Swan, a Portuguese investment firm. On 21 February 2019, Intertoys was declared bankrupt after being unable to restructure after a suspension of payments. On 8 March 2019, Intertoys was sold to Green Swan, although Blokker would later acquire Maxi Toys and Intertoys from the company just months later. Blokker Holding has not entered the stock exchange. In 2019, the Blokker Family sold the holding company to Michiel Witteveen. Witteveen became the CEO and sold less profitable chains. In July 2019, Blokker Holding would be rebranded to Mirage Retail Group to avoid confusion between the holding company and the store chain. Blokker stores in Belgium and Luxembourg were sold to Dutch Retail Group and were subsequently rebranded to Mega World. Maxi Toys was sold to King Jouet in August 2020 after the chain was facing bankruptcy. On 29 September 2020, the company acquired BCC from Fnac Darty.",

Stratified sample size [ edit ] With more complicated sampling techniques, such as stratified sampling , the sample can often be split up into sub-samples. Typically, if there are H such sub-samples (from H different strata) then each of them will have a sample size n h , h = 1, 2, ..., H . These n h must conform to the rule that n 1 + n 2 + ... + n H = n (i.e., that the total sample size is given by the sum of the sub-sample sizes). Selecting these n h optimally can be done in various ways, using (for example) Neyman's optimal allocation. There are many reasons to use stratified sampling: to decrease variances of sample estimates, to use partly non-random methods, or to study strata individually.",

In 2000, they experimented with augmented reality technology, which allowed three-dimensional computer-generated images to appear on stage with the band. They appeared on several century-end video countdowns: The MTV \"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\" featured \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" at No. 11 and \"Girls on Film\" at No. 68, and the \"VH1: 100 Greatest Videos\" listed \"Hungry\" at No. 31 and \"Rio\" at No. 60. MTV named \"Hungry\" the 15th of their most played videos of all time. The band has released several video compilations, starting with the self-titled \"video album\" Duran Duran (1983), for which they won a Grammy Award , up to the 2004 two-disc DVD release Greatest , which included alternative versions of several popular videos as Easter eggs . In addition to Greatest , the documentary Sing Blue Silver , and the concert film Arena (both from 1984) were released on DVD in 2004. Live from London , a concert video from one of their sold-out 2004 reunion shows at Wembley Arena, was released in the fall of 2005. Other video collections, concert films, and documentaries remain available only on videotape, and Duran Duran have not yet released a collection which includes all their videos. The band has said that a huge amount of unreleased concert and documentary footage has been filmed over the years, which they hope can be edited and released in some form in the near future. The video for \"Falling Down\" was released in October 2007. The Nick Egan-directed video for the lead single and title track from All You Need Is Now was premiered via Yahoo Music on 20 December 2010.",

Justin Timberlake is a fan of the band and presented them with the Outstanding Contribution award at the 2004 Brit Awards . The most recent crop of performers to name Duran Duran as an influence include the Dandy Warhols , the Bravery , Dido , Panic! at the Disco , Goldfrapp , and Brandon Flowers of the Killers , who said, \"Nick Rhodes is an absolute hero of mine—their records still sound fresh, which is no mean feat as far as synths are concerned.\" Franz Ferdinand would play \"Girls on Film\" to make them \"feel glamorous\". Rhodes has directly lent his production techniques to Kajagoogoo 's debut album White Feathers (1983) and its number one single \" Too Shy \", and to the Dandy Warhols' fourth album Welcome to the Monkey House (2003). The band's music has been used by several hip hop artists, most notably the Notorious B.I.G. , who sampled Duran Duran's 1986 single \"Notorious\". Numerous bands have covered their music on record and in concert.",

And if she hadn't had a terrific sense of humor, that probably would have been the end of my fieldwork, right that day. After being granted a $40,000 ($64,399 in 2024 ) fellowship by the National Endowment for the Humanities , the project culminated in a dictionary and grammar . Rankin eventually had to stop recording after sustaining a back injury which required surgery; his informants died shortly thereafter, the last speakers of the Kansa language. Rankin ultimately pursued an interest in the Siouan languages which were spoken nearby, in part because of their endangered status. During his career, Rankin primarily focused on historical phonology of the Siouan languages, namely the Dhegiha subfamily and the Kansa language in particular. He was also an active lexicographer and philologist and published works on the Iroquoian and Muskogean languages as well as more broadly in archeology , typology , and the history of linguistics itself. Rankin later returned to Quapaw, working with its last speaker and later creating a dictionary and grammar as he had with Kansa. His outline of the Ofo language , another Siouan language, corrected massive failures and mistakes of previous literature. At Kansas University, Rankin was promoted twice, achieving full professorship in 1986. He retired in 2005, though he continued to be involved in academia afterward. His final publication was made in 2012, entitled Kaa ze Ie Wayaje : An Annotated Dictionary of Kaw (Kanza) .",

On 9 August 2018, Gandhi was detained by immigration authorities at Bangalore Airport on his return to India. He was handed over to Chennai Police by the airport police. Gandhi was charged under Section 124 A (sedition), 153 A (1) and 153 (b) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race etc.) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) . He was produced in court the next day, where the police argued that a video of his speech uploaded by the UNHRC instigated hatred among people. Magistrate S Prakash refused to detain him and asked for him to be set free after interrogation. A few minutes after the police released him, he was again arrested, without a warrant. A video of the police kidnapping Thirumurugan Gandhi went viral on social media. Then Tamil Nadu police took him to puzhal central prison and then he was shifted to Vellore Central Prison . On 24 August 2018, Gandhi was produced in court in a sedition case filed for his criticism of corporate influence in a Facebook video. At the court, Gandhi said he had been kept in solitary confinement in the Vellore prison, prevented from meeting his family, and prevented from answering calls of nature. On 26 August, Gandhi was booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) by the Nungambakkam police.

He also supported Turkish nationalism against its Ottoman counterpart, along with secularism ( anti-clericalism or laicism) against theocracy . Frashëri was one of the sons of an impoverished bey from Frashër (Fraşer during Ottoman rule) in the District of Përmet . He gained a place in Ottoman literature as a talented author under the name of Şemseddin Sami Efendi and contributed to the Ottoman Turkish language reforms. Frashëri's message, however as declared in his book \"Albania - What it was, what it is, and what will become of it\" published in 1899, became the manifesto of the Albanian National Awakening. He discussed the prospects for a united, free and independent republic of Albania. In this way, beginning with a demand for autonomy and struggle for their own alphabet and education, Frashëri helped the Albanian National Movement develop its claim for independence. His lifetime goal, as that of many other members of the Albanian renaissance was the development and improvement of Albania's culture and eventual establishment of an independent country. Life [ edit ] Museum house of the Frashëri Brothers in Frashër, Përmet, Albania Sami Frashëri was born in 1850 in the village of Frashër in the Vilayet of Janina , Ottoman Empire (modern Albania ) to a distinguished Muslim Albanian family of Bektashi religious affiliations.",

The day after the riot, men approached and ordered him to return to the North. He agreed to leave that night on a northbound train at midnight; he was escorted safely to the train by a group of about 300 white men.

          "text": "Thereafter a duodecimo volume, neatly printed and bound in vellum, was issued annually until 1673 from the presses of Sebastien Cramoisy and his brother Gabriel Cramoisy in Paris, and of Jean Boullenger in Rouen. Several similar texts that were published prior to 1632 are sometimes considered part of the corpus, but they were not titled as the Relations . No single unified edition existed until Reuben Gold Thwaites , secretary of the Wisconsin Historical Society , led the project to translate into English, unify, and cross-reference the numerous original Relations . Between 1896 and 1901 Thwaites and his associates compiled 73 volumes, including two volumes of indices. The Relations effectively comprise a large body of ethnographic material. He included many other papers, rare manuscripts, and letters from the archives of the Society of Jesus , spanning a period from the founding of the order, or the colonization of Acadia in the 1610s to the mission in the Illinois Country in 1791. The indices are comprehensive in scope and include titles such as: Marriage and Marriage Customs, Courtship, Divorce, Social Status of Women, Songs and Singing, Dances, and Games and Recreation. Much can be learned through the examination and study of the ethnographic and linguistic material compiled by the Jesuit missionaries in New France. The depth of the cross-referencing allows for several hundred years of Native American/European interaction to be easily accessed. While Thwaites is the first and arguably the best known of modern editions, others followed. Lucien Campeau SJ (1967–2003) discussed the texts which he included as well as the historical events they refer to; his work is considered to give the most detailed and exhaustive general overviews available. Indigenous resistance and reaction to the Jesuits [ edit ] Some Indigenous peoples outwardly converted to Catholicism while still adhering to their traditional religion.",

          "text": "Since the idea is about pure mathematics and logic, similar arguments abound much further afield. They, for example, lead to the necessity of the fifth normal form in relational database design. The history of the argument also goes deeper, Condorcet's paradox perhaps being the first example of the finite sort. Pareto efficiency [ edit ] Main article: Pareto efficiency Definition [ edit ] A particular distribution of goods or outcome of any social process is regarded as Pareto-efficient if there is no way to improve one or more people's situations without harming another. Put another way, an outcome is not Pareto-efficient if there is a way to improve at least one person's situation without harming anyone else. For example, suppose a mother has ten dollars which she intends to give to her two children Carlos and Shannon. Suppose the children each want only money, and they do not get jealous of one another. The following distributions are Pareto-efficient: However, a distribution where the mother gives each of them $2 and wastes the remaining $6 is not Pareto-efficient, because she could have given the wasted money to either child and made that child better off without harming the other. In this example, it was presumed that a child was made better or worse off by gaining or losing money, respectively, and that neither child gained or lost by evaluating her share in comparison to the other. To be more precise, we must evaluate all possible preferences that the child might have and consider a situation as Pareto-efficient if there is no other social state that at least one person favors (or prefers) and no one disfavors. Use in economics [ edit ] Pareto efficiency is often used in economics as a minimal sense of economic efficiency . If a mechanism does not result in Pareto-efficient outcomes, it is regarded as inefficient, since there was another outcome that could have made some people better off without harming anyone else.",

          "text": "In 1839, agricultural prices fell, and the pressure reached the agriculturalists. Within two months the losses from bank failures in New York alone aggregated nearly $100 million. Out of 850 banks in the United States, 343 closed entirely, 62 failed partially, and the system of state banks received a shock from which it never fully recovered. The publishing industry was particularly hurt by the ensuing depression. Many individual states defaulted on their bonds, which angered British creditors. The United States briefly withdrew from international money markets. Only in the late 1840s did Americans re-enter those markets. The defaults, along with other consequences of the recession, carried major implications for the relationship between the state and economic development. In some ways, the panic undermined confidence in public support for internal improvements. The panic unleashed a wave of riots and other forms of domestic unrest. The ultimate result was an increase in the state's police powers, including more professional police forces. Recovery [ edit ] Hard times token , late 1830s; privately minted, used in place of the one-cent coin during currency shortage; inscription reads \"I Take the Responsibility\", showing Andrew Jackson holding a drawn sword and a coin bag emerging from a strongbox . Most economists agree that there was a brief recovery from 1838 to 1839, which ended when the Bank of England and Dutch creditors raised interest rates. The economic historian Peter Temin has argued that when corrected for deflation, the economy grew moderately after 1838. In 1842, the American economy was able to rebound somewhat and overcome the five-year depression, but according to most accounts, the economy did not recover until 1844. The recovery from the depression intensified after the California gold rush started in 1848, greatly increasing the money supply. By 1850, the US economy was booming again. Intangible factors like confidence and psychology played powerful roles and helped to explain the magnitude and the depth of the panic.",

          "text": "The catcher must then attempt to throw the ball to first base ahead of the runner, or the runner is safe. With two outs, the batter can attempt to run to first whether or not it is already occupied. Depending on the league in slow pitch only a foul ball with two strikes on the batter means the batter is out. Stealing in 16-inch softball is severely restricted, as a runner may only steal the base in front of them if it is open, and if they are thrown at, à la pickoff move or snap throw. This results in many inexperienced players being thrown or doubled off when they attempt to advance on a wild pickoff at another baserunner. Scoring runs [ edit ] A collision at home plate — the player in red scores as the catcher has failed to secure the ball. A \"run\" is scored when a player has touched all four bases in order, proceeding counterclockwise around them. They need not be touched on the same play; a batter may remain safely on a base while play proceeds and attempt to advance on a later play. A run is not scored if the last out is a force out or occurs during the same play that the runner crosses home plate. Ending the game [ edit ] The team with the most runs after seven innings wins the game. The last (bottom) half of the seventh inning or any remaining part of the seventh inning is not played if the team batting second is leading. If the game is tied, play usually continues until a decision is reached, by using the international tie-breaker rules. Starting in the top of first extra inning, the batting team starts with a baserunner on second base, which is the player who is the last available to bat (in other words, the batter who last took their position in the batter's box; regardless whether they were the last out or another runner was put out).",

          "text": "The Dunhong Mountain ( Chinese : 敦薨山 ), according to Classic of Mountains and Seas , is a mountain of the Tian Shan range. This mountain has been proposed to be the homeland of the Yuezhi . According to archaeologist Lin Meicun (林梅村), this is the Dunhuang ( Chinese : 燉煌 ) mentioned in the Shiji by Sima Qian , which states that: The Yuezhi originally lived in the area between the Qilian Shan and Dunhuang , but after they were defeated by the Xiongnu they moved far away to the west, beyond Dayuan [the Ferghana Valley], where they attacked and conquered the people of Daxia [Bactria] ... Lin Meicun argued that the present Dunhuang ( Chinese : 敦煌, 燉煌 ), a Gansu oasis town, was founded around 111 BC, that is, later than the report of Zhang Qian on the Yuezhi (126 BC). Therefore, the Dunhuan referred to in the Shiji cannot be the city currently bearing that name, and is most likely an oasis near Turpan . Place names such Dunhong and Qilian may have had Indo-European etymologies, from at two possible sources. For example: Lin Meicun suggested that Dunhuan is the Chinese spelling of Tushara (an Eastern Iranian people ), and; Victor Mair noted the word kaelum in the Tocharian languages of the Tarim Basin, meaning \"sky\" or \"heaven\" (and therefore related distantly to the Latin caelum ) which may have been the basis of qilian . According to a Tang Dynasty commentator on the Shiji , qilian was a Xiongnu word for \"sky\" – although Xiongnu may also have borrowed the word from an Indo-European language.",

After that point, new sporting facilities were being built around the country and many new sport clubs were created. During the 1900s in Australia, lacrosse became more socially acceptable for women to participate in. Subsequently, female participation rates rose in places like Queensland . In 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for medical reasons, some girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Soccer was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. Sports which were medically appropriate for all girls, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, were swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding. Australian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II . Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and had held competitions during the war. This structure survived in the post-war period. Women's sports were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.

Volleyball is one of the sports that is played at the Summer Olympic Games in two disciplines: the traditional six-per-side indoor game, and the newer game of beach volleyball . Indoor volleyball was added to the Olympic programme in 1957 at the 53rd session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Sofia, Bulgaria , and the first competitions were held at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo . The Soviet Union won a medal in both the men's and women's competition at the first five Olympics that included volleyball, including the men's gold medal in Tokyo. The Japanese women's team won the gold at the inaugural Olympic volleyball competition, and the silver at the following two Games. The Montreal Games of 1976 saw the Polish men win the nation's only gold medal in the sport, after the women had won bronze in 1964 and 1968. At the 1980 Moscow Olympics , the hosts won gold in both competitions. The Bulgarian team won their only two volleyball medals in Moscow, a silver and a bronze in the men's and women's tournament, respectively. The United States won its first medals in volleyball at the Los Angeles Games: a gold in the men's competition, and a silver in the women's. The People's Republic of China won the gold medal in the women's competition in Los Angeles, their first time participating in an Olympic volleyball competition. The United States successfully defended their men's gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, and Peru won their only medal in volleyball, a silver in the women's competition.",

          "text": "In February 1984, the band appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and won two Grammy Awards in the brand-new Long Form and Short Form music video categories. Meanwhile, \" Save a Prayer \" gained momentum in North America, and a special US remix of the song became a single in January 1985. It peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March. A live version of the song was used for the single's B-side, taken from the concert video footage for Arena / As the Lights Go Down . During this period, all of the band members became heartthrobs for many of their young teenage fans. After the tour, Roger Taylor was married in Naples , Italy , and Rhodes wed in London, wearing a pink velvet tuxedo and top hat. At the end of 1984, the group featured on the Band Aid benefit single \" Do They Know It's Christmas? \" along with other popular British and Irish musical acts. Le Bon sang fourth on the song, after Paul Young , Boy George and George Michael sing their lines. Even with Duran Duran on hold, band members were soon anxious to record new music, leading to a supposedly temporary split into two side projects. John Taylor and Andy Taylor wanted to break away from the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with lead vocalist Robert Palmer and Chic 's drummer Tony Thompson to form the rock/ funk supergroup the Power Station , releasing two top 10 singles. Le Bon and Rhodes wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed Arcadia , releasing one album ( So Red the Rose ) and an accompanying single (\" Election Day \"). Contributors to that album included guitarist Masami Tsuchiya , bassist Mark Egan , percussionist David Van Tieghem , drummer Steve Jordan , Sting , Herbie Hancock and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd .",

          "text": "Larger projection CRTs in general lasted longer, and were able to provide higher brightness levels and resolution, but were also more expensive. Projection CRTs have an unusually high anode voltage for their size (such as 27 or 25 kV for a 5 or 7-inch projection CRT respectively), and a specially made tungsten/barium cathode (instead of the pure barium oxide normally used) that consists of barium atoms embedded in 20% porous tungsten or barium and calcium aluminates or of barium, calcium and aluminum oxides coated on porous tungsten; the barium diffuses through the tungsten to emit electrons. The special cathode can deliver 2 mA of current instead of the 0.3mA of normal cathodes, which makes them bright enough to be used as light sources for projection. The high anode voltage and the specially made cathode increase the voltage and current, respectively, of the electron beam, which increases the light emitted by the phosphors, and also the amount of heat generated during operation; this means that projector CRTs need cooling. The screen is usually cooled using a container (the screen forms part of the container) with glycol; the glycol may itself be dyed, or colorless glycol may be used inside a container which may be colored (forming a lens known as a c-element). Colored lenses or glycol are used for improving color reproduction at the cost of brightness, and are only used on red and green CRTs. Each CRT has its own glycol, which has access to an air bubble to allow the glycol to shrink and expand as it cools and warms. Projector CRTs may have adjustment rings just like color CRTs to adjust astigmatism, which is flaring of the electron beam (stray light similar to shadows). They have three adjustment rings; one with two poles, one with four poles, and another with 6 poles.",

          "text": "Thus, the interior is evacuated to less than a millionth of atmospheric pressure . As such, handling a CRT carries the risk of violent implosion that can hurl glass at great velocity. The face is typically made of thick lead glass or special barium - strontium glass to be shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions. This tube makes up most of the weight of CRT TVs and computer monitors. Since the late 2000s, CRTs have been superseded by flat-panel display technologies such as liquid-crystal display (LCD), plasma display , and OLED displays which are cheaper to manufacture and run, as well as significantly lighter and thinner. Flat-panel displays can also be made in very large sizes whereas 40–45 inches (100–110 cm) was about the largest size of a CRT. A CRT works by electrically heating a tungsten coil which in turn heats a cathode in the rear of the CRT, causing it to emit electrons which are modulated and focused by electrodes. The electrons are steered by deflection coils or plates, and an anode accelerates them towards the phosphor -coated screen, which generates light when hit by the electrons. History [ edit ] Discoveries [ edit ] Cathode rays were discovered by Julius Plücker and Johann Wilhelm Hittorf . Hittorf observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the cathode (negative electrode) which could cast shadows on the glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, Arthur Schuster demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by electric fields , and William Crookes showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. In 1897, J. J.",

The neck is made from a glass tube while the funnel and screen are made by pouring and then pressing glass into a mold. The glass, known as CRT glass or TV glass, needs special properties to shield against x-rays while providing adequate light transmission in the screen or being very electrically insulating in the funnel and neck. The formulation that gives the glass its properties is also known as the melt. The glass is of very high quality, being almost contaminant and defect free. Most of the costs associated with glass production come from the energy used to melt the raw materials into glass. Glass furnaces for CRT glass production have several taps to allow molds to be replaced without stopping the furnace, to allow production of CRTs of several sizes. Only the glass used on the screen needs to have precise optical properties. The optical properties of the glass used on the screen affect color reproduction and purity in color CRTs. Transmittance, or how transparent the glass is, may be adjusted to be more transparent to certain colors (wavelengths) of light. Transmittance is measured at the center of the screen with a 546 nm wavelength light, and a 10.16mm thick screen. Transmittance goes down with increasing thickness. Standard transmittances for Color CRT screens are 86%, 73%, 57%, 46%, 42% and 30%. Lower transmittances are used to improve image contrast but they put more stress on the electron gun, requiring more power on the electron gun for a higher electron beam power to light the phosphors more brightly to compensate for the reduced transmittance. The transmittance must be uniform across the screen to ensure color purity. The radius (curvature) of screens has increased (grown less curved) over time, from 30 to 68 inches, ultimately evolving into completely flat screens, reducing reflections.",

          "text": "The bat is held with both hands, over the shoulder, and away from the pitcher (90-degree angle). The ball is usually hit with a full swinging motion in which the bat may move through more than 360 degrees. The batter usually steps forward with the front foot, the body weight shifts forward, as the batter simultaneously swings the bat. A bunt is another form of batting. There are different types, including a sacrifice bunt , or slap bunt . There is also regular slapping in which a batter takes position on the left side of the plate and usually stands in the back of the box, but it is possible form anywhere. The batter takes a step back with their leading foot as the pitcher is in the middle of the windup, crosses over with their back foot and runs toward first base while they swing. There are many different types of slapping and they all vary depending on the batter and their strengths. There are half swing slaps, fake slaps, and full swing slaps. Each type of slap has a different purpose or goal. No matter what way the batter hits the ball, they must be inside the batter's box when the bat makes contact with the ball. If the batter steps out of the box while swinging, the batter is out. Once the ball is hit into fair territory, the runner must try to advance to first base or beyond. While running to first base, the batter is a \"batter-runner\". When she safely reaches first (see below) she becomes a \"base-runner\" or \"runner\". A batted ball hit high in the air is a \"fly ball\". A fly ball hit upward at an angle greater than 45 degrees is a \"pop fly\". A batted ball driven in the air through the infield at a height at which an infielder could play it if in the right position is a \"line drive\". A batted ball which hits the ground within the diamond is a \"ground ball\".",

He was forced by the Pakistan Army to unlawfully leave the country and close down The Institute for Social Movements, Pakistan in May 2012. He resettled in Nepal , where the UNHCR approved him for refugee status. In Kathmandu, he began freelancing with newspapers and websites on the issues of Pakistan, particularly concerning Sindh and the restive province of Balochistan. He was insurrected in his house in Kathmandu and was given heavy metal poison by the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI with local facilitation; however he was rescued by local doctors. He was forced to leave Nepal, thus he left for Pakistan in December 2013. In Pakistan, he again was persecuted and threatened to be killed. He went to India for medical treatment on 11 February 2013, where he was not only denied appropriate health treatment at the behest of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, but was also harassed by high commission officials. He, along his wife Fatima Shah, gave a protest sit-in for 285 days near the Parliament of the Republic of India in defiance of the threats against his life committed by the Pakistan High Commission and its facilitation by the Indian authorities. On his website, Shah has claimed that he and his wife Ghulam Fatima Shah were inserted a gadget / chip in their body by USA and India on the demand of Pakistan. He has also claimed that through that chip he has been tortured and attempts of murders were carried by Pakistani officials. Shah was born in a rural town Radhan of district Dadu , Sindh province in Pakistan .",

History of the Hotak Dynasty [ edit ] Rise to power and Reign of Mirwais Hotak [ edit ] Decline of the Safavids [ edit ] The Shi'a Safavids ruled Loy Kandahar as their easternmost territory from the 16th century until the early 18th century. At the same time, the native Afghan tribes living in the area were Sunni Muslims . Immediately to the east was the powerful Sunni Mughal Empire , who occasionally fought wars with the powerful Safavids over the territory of southern Afghanistan. The Khanate of Bukhara controlled the area to the north at the same time. By the late 17th century, the Safavids started to decline. With the death of Shah Abbas in 1629, succeeding Safavid rulers were less effective and caused the empire to decline. On 29 July 1694, Shah Suleiman died and Sultan Husayn took the throne. Under his reign the problems worsened. Husayn barely left the palace during his reign, not an uncommon aspect of many later Safavid Shahs. Later Safavid rulers were immobile and their courts were riddled with factionalism unlike their more mobile ancestors who spent more time on campaigns and had smaller courts. The government was weak and the army was ineffective. This power vacuum allowed tribal groups like the Turkmen , Baluch , Arabs , Kurds , Dagestanis , and Afghans to constantly raid frontier provinces. Governorship of Gurgin Khan [ edit ] In 1704, the Safavid Shah Husayn appointed his Georgian subject and king of Kartli George XI ( Gurgīn Khān ), a convert to Islam , as the governor of Kandahar .",

On 23 October 1722, Sultan Husayn abdicated and acknowledged Mahmud as the new Shah of Persia. For the next seven years until 1729, the Hotaks were the de facto rulers of most of Persia, and the southern areas of Afghanistan remained under their control until 1738. The Bakhtiari attacked and killed thousands of Hotakis. Mahmoud Hotaki's campaign against the Bakhtiari was met with disappointment and heavy casualties, ultimately failing to capture the Bakhtiari lands. The Hotak dynasty was a troubled and violent one from the very start as an internecine conflict made it difficult to establish permanent control. The majority of Persians rejected the leaders as usurpers, and the dynasty lived under great turmoil due to bloody succession feuds that made their hold on power tenuous. After the massacre of thousands of civilians in Isfahan – including more than three thousand religious scholars, nobles, and members of the Safavid family – the Hotak dynasty was eventually removed from power in Persia. Decline [ edit ] Painting of Battle of Damghan , illustrating Persian decisive artillery fire against the Afghans in 1729 Ashraf Hotak took over the monarchy following Shah Mahmud's death in 1725.

After Live Aid and Arcadia, Roger Taylor left the band and retired to the English countryside, suffering from exhaustion. Andy Taylor led the remaining members to believe he would return to work on a new Duran Duran album, even as he was signing a solo recording contract in Los Angeles with MCA Records , eventually releasing a solo album in 1986 called Thunder . The band resorted to legal measures to get him into the studio but after numerous delays they let him go at last. He played on only a few songs on the next album, including \"A Matter of Feeling\", whilst the disagreements were being settled. Without a guitarist or a drummer, Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor had producer (and former Chic guitarist) Nile Rodgers play a few tracks on guitar, and hired Steve Ferrone to play drums while they searched for replacements. In September 1986, Warren Cuccurullo (formerly of Missing Persons and Frank Zappa 's band) was hired as a session guitarist. With Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor, he recorded the rest of the Notorious album, which was released in October 1986. The black-and-white documentary film Three to Get Ready chronicled the recording of the album, legal tensions, and preparations for the tour. Although the song \" Notorious \" was a US and UK top ten hit, the album was a relative failure globally, reaching number 16 in the UK and spending one week in the top 50 album chart.",

          "text": "\" Come Undone \", primarily written by Cuccurullo, with lyrics by Le Bon, made number seven in the US and number 13 in the UK. Both the band and the record label seemed to be caught by surprise by the album's critical and commercial success (number four in the UK, number seven in the US). John Taylor had been considering leaving the band but changed his mind. The band's largest tour ever, which included stops in the Middle East, the then recently de-embargoed South Africa, and South America, was halted after seven months when Le Bon suffered from strained vocal cords . After six weeks' recuperation, the band performed intermittently for another five months, including appearances in Israel, Thailand, and Indonesia. In 1995, the band released the cover album Thank You . Songs from Thank You included covers of Lou Reed 's \" Perfect Day \" and Melle Mel 's \" White Lines (Don't Don't Do It) \" (with backing vocals from the original artists). The album also marked the temporary return of former drummer Roger Taylor, who joined the band in studio to play drums on \" Watching the Detectives \" and \"Perfect Day\" (as well as a cover of \" Jeepster \" by T. Rex that did not appear on the album). In a video interview provided with the album's electronic press kit , Reed said he considered Duran Duran's version the best cover ever done of one of his songs, and they received praise from Robert Plant and Jimmy Page for their cover of Led Zeppelin 's \" Thank You \". 1997–2000: John Taylor's departure and second trio [ edit ] After the promo tour for Thank You was completed, John Taylor co-founded the B5 Records label, recorded a solo album, founded and toured with the supergroup Neurotic Outsiders , and reunited the Power Station, though the project proceeded without him when he had to withdraw to deal with his divorce.",

Aided by the political climate of the postwar period, the party experienced its peak in the 1950s: It was represented by the biggest parliamentary delegation in the Federal Council , and from 1954 to 1958 the party occupied three out of seven seats in the cabinet. Nonetheless, the party had to relinquish the third seat in favor of the ' magic formula ', which was introduced to the cabinet in 1959. In 1957 it changed its name to the Conservative-Christian-Social People's Party ( German : Konservativ-Christlichsoziale Volkspartei ) and to its current name in 1970. In the ensuing decades, the Catholic voter base dissolved somewhat. The reduction of the voter base, in addition to less cohesion among politicians in the party, led to six successive losses in federal elections after 1980. The party lost its support over a number of years. Beginning in the 1990s, conservative voters from former strongholds of the CVP switched to vote for the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party . From the 1995 election to the 2019 election , the CVP's vote share decreased from 16.8% to 11.4%. After the 2003 election , Ruth Metzler of the CVP, was replaced by Christoph Blocher of the Swiss People's Party on the Federal Council , leaving the CVP with only one seat in the country's executive. CVP President Gerhard Pfister and BDP President Martin Landolt , the leader of the Conservative Democratic Party, had ongoing discussions about a merger throughout 2020. In 2020, Pfister announced that the national CVP would undergo a change in branding with a new name and logo as part of a merger with the BDP.",

This resurgence was partially credited to Bos' charisma and youthful appearance (and according to some journalists Bos' \"sexy touch\"). Balkenende's CDA however remained largest the party by a margin of two seats. The ensuing coalition formation talks between Balkenende and Bos failed after several months. The CDA went on to form a government with the conservative liberal VVD , and the progressive liberal D66 . At that time Bos was the leader of the largest opposition party. He spent considerable time reforming the PvdA's internal organisation and public image, together with the party's chairman Ruud Koole . He was criticized for his silence on important reforms and issues, and his moderacy which resulted in other parties claiming opposition leadership, among them most notably the Socialist Party . Although still enjoying large public support, criticism about his \"style over substance\" approach to politics was voiced in this period. At the December 2005 party congress, Bos announced that he aspired to become Prime Minister of the Netherlands , should the PvdA succeed in becoming the biggest party after the next parliament elections. And in the 2006 municipal elections , a few months later, the PvdA performed particularly well, becoming the largest party in local government. However, in the election campaign for the Dutch general elections of 2006 the PvdA – for the second time campaigning under his leadership – didn't manage to maintain this position as biggest party. Some considered pension reforms proposed by him to embattle the consequences of an aging population as a reason for this decline in popularity. Others emphasized a declining confidence in Bos among parts of the electorate that perceived him as \"unreliable\", as reason for this.",

          "text": "One attempts to identify who was involved in a deviation from the recommended procedure, and the other attempts to identify why deviation from the recommended procedure seemed to be a good idea at the time. The first approach tends to apportion blame, on the assumption that the recommended procedure was, in fact, optimum, and the other aims to learn why the recommended procedure was not considered appropriate at the time. This second approach has been shown to be more productive of learning from the experience, but can only work within a just culture in which the people involved feel safe to discuss the details. Categories of error [ edit ] Reason categorizes how errors occur by analysing what causes a plan to fail. If a plan is good, but poorly executed, then failure is due to slips, lapses, trips or fumbles . If the plan itself is faulty, then failure is due to a mistake . If established or approved procedures or regulations are intentionally ignored, then a mistake can be categorised as a violation . Levels of performance [ edit ] These error categories relate to three levels of human performance: Skill-based: Routine, practiced tasks performed in a largely automatic fashion, with occasional conscious progress checks. Rule-based: If the automatic responses are unsuitable, a switch of level can be made where memorized performance patterns or rules are applied. These are structured on an If (situation), then do (actions) pattern, often similar to one from previous experience, and perceptions of the current situation are used to select an appropriate solution from memory. Potential solutions are developed through education, training, and experience, and are selected automatically from memory, but verified that they are appropriate by conscious thought. Knowledge-based: When solutions from memory do not suit the current situation, the fall back is to knowledge-based solutions, where the current situation must be analysed and a solution developed in real time. Performance is relatively slow and laborious and the process is subject to errors resulting from constraints of information, time, understanding, intelligence and distractions.",

It was independent at some point in the Archaic period . Situated in a plateau in the region of Mount Helicon in the southeast of Boeotia, it was between Thisbe and Coroneia , near modern Agia Anna in the plain of Kourkoura, which at approximately 45 square kilometres (17 sq mi) was sufficient to sustain a small polis. Later its territory was divided between Thisbe and Coroneia. Hippotae also figures in a tale in Greek mythology . Phocus of Glisas , was father of a beautiful daughter Callirhoe. She was wooed by thirty suitors, but Phocus was hesitant to let his daughter marry one of them. At last he announced he would be consulting the Pythian Oracle before making a final decision; the suitors got outraged by that and killed Phocus. Callirhoe had to flee from the suitors; some peasants hid her away in the grain, and thus she escaped them. During the festival of Pamboeotia , she went to the shrine of Athena Itonia at Coroneia and revealed the crime of her suitors to the public; the people sympathized with her and declared a war on her father's murderers. Those sought refuge first in Orchomenus , and then at Hippotae. The inhabitants of Hippotae refused to deliver them up, so the Boeotian army under command of the Theban governor Phoedus captured the town, enslaved its citizens and stoned the suitors to death. The town was destroyed, and the land divided between Thisbe and Coroneia.",

          "text": "The catcher must then attempt to throw the ball to first base ahead of the runner, or the runner is safe. With two outs, the batter can attempt to run to first whether or not it is already occupied. Depending on the league in slow pitch only a foul ball with two strikes on the batter means the batter is out. Stealing in 16-inch softball is severely restricted, as a runner may only steal the base in front of them if it is open, and if they are thrown at, à la pickoff move or snap throw. This results in many inexperienced players being thrown or doubled off when they attempt to advance on a wild pickoff at another baserunner. Scoring runs [ edit ] A collision at home plate — the player in red scores as the catcher has failed to secure the ball. A \"run\" is scored when a player has touched all four bases in order, proceeding counterclockwise around them. They need not be touched on the same play; a batter may remain safely on a base while play proceeds and attempt to advance on a later play. A run is not scored if the last out is a force out or occurs during the same play that the runner crosses home plate. Ending the game [ edit ] The team with the most runs after seven innings wins the game. The last (bottom) half of the seventh inning or any remaining part of the seventh inning is not played if the team batting second is leading. If the game is tied, play usually continues until a decision is reached, by using the international tie-breaker rules. Starting in the top of first extra inning, the batting team starts with a baserunner on second base, which is the player who is the last available to bat (in other words, the batter who last took their position in the batter's box; regardless whether they were the last out or another runner was put out).",

          "text": "Chronicles of the Jesuit missions in New France Cover of the Jesuit Relations for 1662–1663 The Jesuit Relations , also known as Relations des Jésuites de la Nouvelle-France (Relation de ce qui s'est passé [...]) , are chronicles of the Jesuit missions in New France . The works were written annually and printed beginning in 1632 and ending in 1673. Originally written in French , Latin , and Italian , The Jesuit Relations were reports from Jesuit missionaries in the field to their superiors to update them as to the missionaries' progress in the conversion of various Indigenous North American tribes, including the Huron , Montagnais , Miꞌkmaq , Mohawk , and Algonquins . Constructed as narratives, the original reports of the Jesuit missionaries were subsequently transcribed and altered several times before their publication, first by the Jesuit overseer in New France and then by the Jesuit governing body in France. The Jesuits began to shape the Relations for the general public, in order to attract new settlers to the colony and to raise enough capital and political support to continue the missions in New France. Overall, these texts serve as microcosms of Indigenous-European relations in North America. The Relations are integral to the historiography of the Jesuits of New France. Recent scholarship illuminates how these documents may have been re-circulated back to Jesuit colleges in New France, which changes how one can understand their ethnographic and knowledge-producing value. History [ edit ] Jesuit missionaries had to write annual reports to their superior in Québec or Montréal as an account of their activities.",

From the nature of information and knowledge, those could make enormous social inequality (ex. class, state, sex, education, region etc.). Furthermore, a global effect feature, one of the information and knowledge's nature, can deepen global inequality and further sharpen the 2080 society, called Pareto's law . Reasons and correlating variables [ edit ] Distribution of hardware [ edit ] The most basic reason is the distribution of hardware. The most basic hardware in the information era is a computer, which creates an information gap between those who have difficulties buying a computer and those who do not. According to the '2016 Information Gap Index and Survey' in South Korea, which conducted by the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) on 6,300 people nationwide, while only 53.2% of the underprivileged people have personal computer, the average proportion of whole people are nearly 83%. Computer penetration rates are affected by many correlating variables such as region, education, and income and these variables can issue a complex impact. To overcome this difference, OLPC (One Laptop per child) is developing and also distributing $100 computer. In addition, a project for the free use of the internet such as the fund router project is in progress, but it is not widely available in Korea. As 'ubiquitous' becomes more and more popular, the distribution of small hardware is expected to grow even more and the digital divide is expected to deepen further. Education [ edit ] Education is the most relevant part of income in Korea. Children of lower income earners have fewer educational opportunities than higher income earners. For this reason, the children of the low educated are more likely to be a low educated students than those of highly educated people, and this phenomenon leads to a vicious cycle of social inequality . Because the information era is built on capitalism , this vicious circle is likely to lead to current society as well.",

Chicken ( kukhura ) and fish are usually acceptable to all including the Khas Brahmin ( Bahun ) caste. Observant Hindus never eat beef ( gai ko masu ). They also eschew buffalo and yak meat as being too cow-like. Domestic pork ( sungur ko masu ) was traditionally only eaten by aadibasi, however wild boar ( bangur ko masu ) was traditionally hunted and eaten by magars . A strain derived from wild boar is now raised in captivity and used for meat that is increasingly popular with Pahari ethnicities and castes that did not traditionally eat pork. They however eat wild boar ( bandel ) as it is considered clean due to its forest habitat though they do not eat pork meat.

          "text": "Among these guests, the Johnson daughters looked for potential suitors, as they were pressured to marry a prominent young man. John Quincy Adams became one such guest in 1795 in his capacity as an American diplomat. He began showing up each day, and only later did the Johnsons realize that he intended to court Louisa, initially believing that his interest was in her older sister Nancy. Only after he complied with a joking request to write her a romantic poem did she consider him a potential suitor. Johnson and Adams began a courtship, though it was intermittent, and they did not immediately take to one another. Both had previously expressed interest in other potential partners. It was their talents and prestige that eventually drew them to one another. Adams in particular was taken by Johnson's aptitude for singing and music. This pairing also caused a rivalry between Louisa and her older sister, who was jealous for the man she thought would court her. Johnson and Adams were engaged by 1796, but Adams left England for work and provided a number of excuses as to why he felt they should not be wed, citing his work, his finances, and their personality conflicts. Another factor was the disapproval of his mother, Abigail Adams , who did not wish to see her son marry an Englishwoman. They communicated by letter over the following year, and Johnson came to dread their communications, as Adams's letters were humorless and chastising. Louisa and John eventually married on July 26, 1797, after pressuring from her father. Shortly after the marriage, the Johnsons lost the remainder of their fortune. Louisa's parents fled the country, leaving Louisa and John with little financial support and a mob of angry creditors. The couple disagreed about how much influence a wife should have in her family, and John often made major decisions without consulting her. Both had strong personalities, and their disagreements often became arguments.",

The objectives included attempting to determine familial relationships among 11 royal mummies of the New Kingdom, as well to research for pathological features including potential inherited disorders and infectious diseases. In 2022, S.O.Y. Keita analysed 8 Short Tandem loci (STR) data published as part of these studies by Hawass et al., using an algorithm that only has three choices: Eurasians, sub-Saharan Africans, and East Asians. Using these three options, Keita concluded that the majority of the samples, which included the genetic remains of Tutankhamun, showed a population \"affinity with \" sub-Saharan \" Africans in one affinity analysis\". However, Keita cautioned that this does not mean that the royal mummies \"lacked other affiliations\" which he argued had been obscured in typological thinking. Keita further added that different \"data and algorithms might give different results\" which reflects the complexity of biological heritage and the associated interpretation. According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft, conflicting DNA analysis conducted by different research teams on ancient Egyptians such as the Amarna royal mummies, which included the remains of Tutankhamun, has led to a lack of consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins. In 2025, biochemist Jean-Philippe Gourdine reviewed genetic data on the Ancient Egyptian populations in the international scholarly publication, General History of Africa Volume IX.",

Now calculate the nines' complement of the result 344 [result] 655 [nines' complement of 344 = 999 - (999 - x + y) = x - y, the correct answer] Second method [ edit ] 1. Compute the nines' complement of 218, which is 781. Because 218 is three digits long, this is the same as subtracting 218 from 999. 2. Next, the sum of x {\\displaystyle x} and the nines' complement of y {\\displaystyle y} is taken. 873 [x] + 781 [nines' complement of y = 999 - y] ————— 1654 [999 + x - y] 3. The leading \"1\" digit is then dropped, giving 654. 1654 -1000 [-(999 + 1)] ————— 654 [-(999 + 1) + 999 + x - y] 4. This is not yet correct. In the first step, 999 was added to the equation. Then 1000 was subtracted when the leading 1 was dropped. So, the answer obtained (654) is one less than the correct answer x − y {\\displaystyle x-y} . To fix this, 1 is added to the answer. 654 + 1 ————— 655 [x - y] Adding a 1 gives 655, the correct answer to our original subtraction problem. The last step of adding 1 could be skipped if instead the ten's complement of y was used in the first step.",

          "text": "This system has garnered international attention for its simplicity. Individuals pay a flat rate of 20% on their income, which includes wages, business profits, and capital gains. Additionally, Estonia applies a 20% value-added tax (VAT) to most goods and services. Several countries that have flat taxes include Greenland , which has one of the highest rates in the world (45%). However, Greenland is deficient in many social services when compared to many developed countries. Mongolia , Kazakhstan (10%), Bolivia (13%), as well as other countries, have comparable flat tax rates. Sales tax [ edit ] Conventional or retail sales taxes are only charged to the end user of a good or service. Since all customers pay the same fixed rate of sales tax , regardless of their income, the tax is regarded as proportional. The sales tax rate is applied to both goods and services; the buyer's income is not taken into consideration. Most countries in the world have sales taxes at all or several of the national, state, county, or city government levels. However, consumption taxes such as a sales tax can often exclude items or provide rebates in an effort to create social justice . In many locations, \"necessary\" items such as non-prepared food, clothing, or prescription drugs are exempt from sales tax to alleviate the burden on the poor. Occupational tax [ edit ] An occupational tax is a form of excise tax that is imposed upon persons or business entities for engaging in a profession, trade, or business. Some jurisdictions class business and occupation taxes according to sectors, such as wholesaling, services, retailing, or manufacturing . Within each sector , the tax rate is the same. However, it may vary among classes. Occupational taxes maintain a consistent rate for everyone in a specific occupation or industry, so they are considered proportional.",

          "text": "Progressive tax rates or marginal taxation, which is more common worldwide, is a tax structure in place in developed countries , where those with lower incomes pay a smaller share of taxes. Proportional rates [ edit ] Proportional taxes on consumption are considered by some to be regressive ; that is, low-income people tend to spend a greater percentage of their income in taxable sales (using a cross section timeframe) than higher income people. A regressive tax is when the average tax rate is lower, with higher income. So income and average tax rate have an inverse relationship. However, this calculation is derived when the tax paid is divided not by the tax base (the amount spent) but by income, which is argued to create an arbitrary relationship. The income tax rate itself is proportional, with people with higher incomes paying more tax but at the same rate. If a consumption tax is to be related to income, the unspent income can be treated as tax-deferred (spending savings at a later point in time), at which time it is taxed creating a proportional rate using an income base. Examples [ edit ] Proportional taxes are one of several types of taxes that governments can use to generate revenue. But these examples can be also considered regressive or progressive in different countries. They often exempt items or individuals from taxes to alleviate the burden on the poor. Income tax [ edit ] Eleven U.S. states impose a proportional income rate tax (also referred to as flat tax ) for individuals. These states are as of 2023: Arizona , Colorado , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Michigan , Mississippi , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , and Utah Estonia’s flat tax - Estonia employs a proportional tax rate on personal income, corporate income, and consumption. This system has garnered international attention for its simplicity. Individuals pay a flat rate of 20% on their income, which includes wages, business profits, and capital gains.",

Six episodes aired prior to the mid-season finale on December 17. ABC initially planned to air the remaining episodes beginning on March 4, 2021, but delayed its return by one week. The second half of the season then began airing on March 11, 2021, with the season's seventh episode. This episode also aired outside of its regular timeslot due to a programming delay as a result of a presidential address by Joe Biden , and began broadcasting at 9:25 pm ET. The season finale aired on June 3. Internationally, the season aired in simulcast in Canada on CTV while in the United Kingdom episodes began airing on Sky Witness on April 17, 2021. Home media and streaming services [ edit ] Hulu continued to hold next-day streaming video on demand rights to the series during the season and the most recently aired episodes were also available for streaming on the ABC website. The season was added to Netflix on July 3, 2021, as part of a streaming deal that adds some ABC Shondaland series to Netflix thirty days after the final episode of the season airs. Outside of the United States, the season, along with all past seasons, was added to Star , a content hub within the Disney+ streaming service. A 4-disc DVD set containing all seventeen episodes was released in multiple regions on June 7, 2021. Reception [ edit ] Critical response [ edit ] Ani Bundel with NBC Think stated that the season stayed true to the medical community, noting that even though cheerful and funny moments were mixed in, viewers were not able to forget how many people had died.",

Production on the sixteenth season was later cut short as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , finishing only twenty-one of the twenty-five episodes ordered; at the time it was unknown whether or not the four additional episodes would be produced as part of the seventeenth season. In September 2020, Variety reported that the season would begin filming later that month. Pompeo announced that filming had begun on September 8. An ABC insider later revealed that the network was looking to produce a season of sixteen episodes, down from the twenty-four to twenty-five episodes per season that had been produced since the eighth season , but that the number could change since conditions were uncertain due to COVID. One additional episode was ordered, bringing the total episode count of the season up to seventeen. The lower episode count caused the season to tie with the fourth for the second-lowest number of episodes, only having more than the first . To limit the spread of COVID-19, cast and crew members only worked ten-hour days compared to the usual twelve hours. The number of people in each scene also had to be reduced to allow for social distancing . Vernoff said that face masks were worn by all cast and crew members while not filming, including between takes and during rehearsals, and that speaking was not allowed in the hair and makeup trailer. Cast members carried their own makeup bags to do last-minute touch-ups, and different camera lenses were used to make people standing far apart appear closer together. In addition, the cast and crew members received testing for the virus three times a week. In March 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported that another spin-off series was in the works following an interview with ABC Entertainment President Craig Erwich.",

Márquez then won three successive duels with Dovizioso, in Aragon , Thailand and Japan . At all three circuits, Dovizioso established an early lead, but Márquez laid in wait to pull off a series of successful late passes. In Japan, Dovizioso crashed on the penultimate lap while trying to catch Márquez to attempt a repass. This left him without points, and Márquez cruised over the finish line to score a third consecutive win and a seventh world title. He became the first rider to win three consecutive titles in the premier class since Valentino Rossi. During the celebrations, Márquez dislocated his shoulder after being hugged by Scott Redding . Márquez qualified on pole in Australia , but was overtaken by both Dovizioso and Miller on the seventh lap. Three laps later, the rear end of Márquez's bike was struck by Johann Zarco . Zarco crashed and Márquez's bike took damage which ended his race. Márquez took another pole position in Malaysia , but received a six-place grid penalty following an incident with Iannone in qualifying. He powered through the field to catch race leader Rossi, who crashed out of the race and handed Márquez his ninth victory of the season. At the season finale in Valencia , Márquez crashed, having chosen harder wet tyres than his rivals on a soaked track. 2019: Domination again Márquez's preparations for the 2019 season were compromised due to a shoulder surgery. He still managed to take the fight for victory in Qatar to the final corner, where he ultimately lost out to Dovizioso again.",

Eventually Márquez broke through and was able to establish a gap from the rest of the pack, crossing the line 1.8 seconds clear of Rossi. This performance extended his championship lead over Dovizioso to 33 points, as Dovizioso finished 13th after running off track. However, Márquez missed out on clinching the title in Malaysia , where he finished fourth to Dovizioso's first. The title contest therefore continued to the last round in Valencia . Márquez started the race from pole, but narrowly avoided crashing at Turn 1 and dropped from first to fifth position. Moments later, Dovizioso crashed at turn eight, handing Márquez his sixth world title. 2018: Consistency Márquez kicked off the 2018 season by losing yet another last-lap battle for victory with Dovizioso in Qatar . He then courted controversy in a bizarre race in Argentina . Márquez then stalled his bike while lining up on the grid. In an attempt to restart, he pushed the bike away from his grid position. After the race started, he was issued a ride-through penalty for riding his bike in the wrong direction on the track. Rejoining near the back of the field, Márquez began ploughing through the field. He was issued a second penalty for irresponsible riding following a collision with Aleix Espargaró , and was required to drop a position. Towards the end of the race, Márquez then collided with Rossi and toppled him onto the wet grass. This reignited their feud and earned Márquez a third penalty.",

Political Treatise: Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be [ edit ] Albania cannot exist without the Albanians, the Albanians cannot exist without the Albanian language, and the latter cannot exist without its own alphabet and without schools. — Sami Frashëri, excerpt from Albania , The aforementioned booklet Albania: What she has been, What she is, What she shall be was first published in Albanian without the author's name in 1899, then in French , and in 1904, right after Şemseddin Sami's death, it was published in Sofia under his name and in Turkish with the condition that it was \"literally translated from Albanian\". Turkish historians generally do not accept that this work belongs to Şemseddin Sami and consider the event as an effort to gain prestige to Albanian nationalism by using Şemseddin Sami's reputation and prestige. Considering Şemseddin Sami's intense interest in the issues of Turkishness and Ottomanism, especially in his last years, it can be thought that there is some truth in this view. On the other hand, in Albanian works, there is not the slightest doubt that the Albanian manifesto belongs to Şemseddin Sâmi. The booklet was smuggled out of the Ottoman Empire and published in Bucharest with the identity of the author not appearing in the publication. Publishers from Austro-Hungary printed some of Frashëri's most important works containing nationalist themes with Austro-Hungarian Albanologists Theodor Anton Ippen and Baron Nopcsa financing the translation and distribution of his publications.",

The virus was confirmed to have reached Chile on 3 March 2020. Initial cases had been imported from Southeast Asia and Europe, and expanded into a large number of untraceable infections, placing the country within phase 4 of the pandemic as defined by the World Health Organization , with over 1,000 confirmed cases by 25 March 2020. The cases were concentrated in the Santiago metropolitan area, with outbreaks in other regions in the country. No national lockdown was established in Chile, unlike in neighboring Argentina and Peru , although a night curfew was implemented throughout the country. Quarantines were established locally in different cities and neighborhoods. However, in May 2020 the whole city of Santiago was put under mandatory quarantine due to an increase of cases, and similar situations were extended to most of the largest cities in Chile. Considering its population, by June 2020 Chile had one of the worst outbreaks in the world. Initially, the number of fatalities reported was lower than in other countries in South America , even those with fewer cases. However, in May 2020, the number of cases and deaths increased rapidly, while several sources reported excess deaths not officially attributed to COVID-19, which were not counted. By June 2020, the government confirmed thousands of additional deaths due to COVID-19, including suspected cases where PCR tests were not available. The pandemic reached a peak on 13 June with 195 daily confirmed deaths and nearly 7,000 positive cases. By July 2020, 10,000 people had died, and Chile had the sixth largest number of cases in the world. In the following weeks, the number of daily cases and deaths started to decrease slowly, although some local outbreaks appeared.",

          "text": "Days later, the Cameroonian government announced it was ready for an \"inclusive\" dialogue where anything except Ambazonian independence could be discussed. Meanwhile, a leadership crisis erupted within the IG, forcing smaller separatist movements to pick their loyalties. In June, the separatists announced that they had started producing their own weapons in the warzone. Shortly afterwards, a mine killed four policemen and wounded another six, convincing many that the separatists were no longer outgunned, but indeed well-armed. The same month, it was revealed that the government of Cameroon and separatist movements would enter negotiations. On 27 June, John Fru Ndi was kidnapped for the second time in two months. Heavy fighting took place in July. On 3 July, separatists ambushed a military boat carrying 13 Cameroonian soldiers on the Ekpambiri river, Manyu Division . Three soldiers managed to escape, two were rescued, one was found dead after five days, and seven remain unaccounted for. The Cameroonian Army declared that they knew which base the attackers had come from, and that an operation would be launched to destroy it. On 8 July, at least two gendarmes were killed and several more were wounded in an ambush in Ndop . On 11 July, at least seven separatist fighters were killed in Esu. The next day, armed men kidnapped 30 bus passengers passing through Belo , in an apparent case of infighting among local separatist militias. One Cameroonian soldier and three separatists were killed in Buea on 14 July, and at least one Cameroonian soldier and at least five separatists were killed in Mbiame three days later. Police forces deploy at Kondengui Central Prison, Yaounde , during the July 2019 Cameroon prison riots . Towards the end of July, two major prison riots took place.",

United Nations – Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a statement said that bombs against civilians \"if confirmed, would constitute a serious violation of international humanitarian law and would be condemned by the secretary-general in the strongest terms.\" He later issued another statement saying he was \"outraged.\" Security Council president and Permanent Representative of Brazil to the UN Maria Luiza Viotti said in a statement after closed-door consultations that the Security Council \"condemned the violence and use of force against civilians, deplored the repression against peaceful demonstrators, and expressed deep regret at the deaths of hundreds of civilians\" and also called for \"an immediate end to the violence and for steps to address the legitimate demands of the population, including through national dialogue. They underscored the need to hold to account those responsible for [the] attacks, including by forces under their control, on civilians.\" In the evening of 26 February, the Security Council voted unanimously to pass resolution 1970 introduced by France, the UK, Germany and the US that would sanction ten top Libyan officials, Gaddafi and his family. It also issued travel bans and an arms embargo . The Security Council also referred the situation to the International Criminal Court for a war crimes investigation into \"widespread and systemic attacks\" against protesters. It was only the second time the Security Council had referred a case to the ICC (the first being Darfur ) and the first unanimous referral. Navi Pillay , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , condemned the violence employed by security forces for its use of live ammunition against protesters. On 17 March, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1973 (2011) for a Libyan no-fly zone and all measures, short of an occupying ground force, needed to protect civilians.",

          "text": "In 1889, as his involvement with the generation and distribution of electricity was surging, Westinghouse resigned as president of the Philadelphia Company, but he remained on its board. Growth in the natural gas business slowed in the 1890s, hindered by supply problems and ongoing safety concerns related to gas distribution in homes and businesses. However, the Philadelphia Company continued to grow, spawning enterprises such as Equitable Gas and Duquesne Light . Electric power distribution [ edit ] Westinghouse Electric Company 1888 catalog advertising their \"Alternating System\" In the early 1880s, Westinghouse's interest in railroad switching and natural gas distribution led him to become involved in the then-new field of electrical power distribution. Electric lighting of streets using arc lighting was already a growing business with many companies building systems powered by either locally generated direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). At the same time, Thomas Edison was launching the first DC electric utility designed to light homes and businesses with his patented incandescent bulb . In 1884, Westinghouse began developing his own DC domestic lighting system and hired physicist William Stanley to help work on it. In 1885, Westinghouse became aware of the concept of an electrical transformer introduced by Frenchman Lucien Gaulard and Englishman John Gibbs. Westinghouse was alerted by Guido Pantaleoni, an Italian engineer in his employ, to the already-patented Gaulard-Gibbs transformer design, and to an already deployed system capable of transmitting electricity for many miles near London, Turin, and Rome. They had found that AC electricity could be \"stepped up\" in voltage by a transformer for transmission and then \"stepped down\" by another transformer for lower voltage consumer use. This innovation made it possible for large centralized power plants to generate electricity and supply it over long distances to both cities and places with more dispersed populations.",

Integration and nationalism [ edit ] Bicolor version of the Romani flag , reportedly used by the UGRR One of the key goals of the UGRR was in convincing members and outsiders to use romi (\"Romanies\") over țigani , which it viewed as derogatory. News reports of the 1933 congress and its aftermath used the term, but often in quotation marks, indicating that it \"was not fully accepted by the Romanian public opinion.\" Lăzurică himself extended the neologism to mean \"freedom-loving man\", rather than simply \"man\", and claimed that it had etymological links to Ramayana . As argued by Matei, he had had no objection to using țigani as an endonym during his association with Șerboianu, and had left several written statements describing himself as a \"Gypsy\". Matei notes that the newer term was most likely suggested to him by Nicolae Constantin Batzaria , the Romanian head editor at Adevărul . In his column of September 5, 1933, Batzaria had chided Șerboianu for using an implicitly demeaning and hostile term, arguing for romi as both authentic and preferable. Lăzurică's first documented use of romi is dated by Matei to October 1933, in a manifesto which repeats Batzaria's attack on Șerboianu. His newfound appreciation for the term was challenged by the more senior activist Naftanailă, who, by 1934, had reconciled with the word țigani and was using it in the title of his rival newspaper, Neamul Țigănesc .",

During the occupation of Novopskov , occupation authorities threatened to deprive parents of parental rights if their child did not attend a school with a Russian curriculum. In 2022, the Russian government established a large-scale system of at least 43 children's camps in Russia and Crimea (most of which previously served as children's summer resorts) the main purpose of which appears to be \"integrating children from Ukraine into the Russian government's vision of national culture, history, and society\", according to a report by Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab. Some children have been placed in summer camps in Belarus that are run by Belarusian state-owned corporations by virtue of a decree issued by the Russo-Belarusian Union State . Children in such camps have been subjected to Russification , Russian state propaganda, and military education (including firearm training). Children have also been provided with formal education in accordance with Russia's educational standards (either at the camps or at local schools) in an effort to steer them towards attending university in Russia. Parents in Russian-occupied areas are encouraged or coerced to send their children to these camps (described to them as children's \"summer camps\") for a respite from the war, with the children subsequently subject to indoctrination during their stay and sometimes not returned to the parents as promised. Orphans, children from Ukrainian state institutions, and children who have become separated from their legal guardians due to the conflict are also sent to these camps before their eventual adoption and/or placement in foster care in Russia. At least 6,000 Ukrainian children have attended such camps; analysis of information from public accounts and satellite imagery has indicated the number of children housed in such camps to be far higher.",

The Protestant Independent Labour Party , alternatively spelt Protestant Independent Labor and sometimes known as the Protestant Labour Party , was a minor Australian political party that operated mainly in New South Wales , Queensland and South Australia in the 1920s and 1930s. It was formed by Walter Skelton in July 1923 as the Protestant Independent Labour Party. who had stood for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly district of Newcastle at the 1922 election , campaigning as a Protestant Independent Labour candidate, in which he was elected first of five members, receiving 25.19% of the vote. In 1925 he was re-elected to the Assembly under the Protestant Labour label, as the second of five members, receiving 17.70% of the vote. The party stood candidates in 12 of the 24 districts however Skelton was the only one elected, with the next highest candidate receiving 5.10% of the district vote. In 1924, Walter Skelton was elected President of the New South Wales division of the party, in Hamilton, New South Wales , which was the main faction of the party. When single-member constituencies were re-introduced in 1927 Skelton stood for the seat of Wallsend but was defeated by the Labor candidate, receiving 42.19% of the vote. Skelton stood again for the 1928 Hamilton by-election but was again defeated by the Labor candidate, receiving 48.78% of the vote after the distribution of preferences. At the 1927 South Australian election , Thomas Thompson was elected under the Protestant Labor Party banner to the two-member seat of Port Adelaide , increasing his margin in a by-election following a challenge to his election. In 1930 he stood for the Legislative Council but was unsuccessful, as were the two Protestant Labor candidates for his former seat of Port Adelaide.",
